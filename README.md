Welcome to the `sauce-docs`, this website contains all technical documentation about Sauce Labs and its products. This site uses [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

2. [Installation](#installation)
3. [Local Development](#local-development)
4. [Contributing](#contributing)

## Prerequisites

* [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `version >= 10.15.1` or above (which can be checked by running node -v). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) `version >= 1.5` (which can be checked by running yarn version). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the npm client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional if you want to deploy locally via a container or to test before you deploy)

## Installation

* Pull down this repo:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-docs.git
	```

* Change directory to `sauce-docs`:

    ```bash
    cd sauce-docs
    ```

* Install the dependencies:

	```
	yarn install
	```

    > If you have trouble with `yarn`, you can try `npm install` instead.

## Local Development

* Start the website:

	```
	yarn start
	```

	This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window (http://localhost:3000). Most changes perform live updates to your server without having to restart.

* Build the website:

	```
	yarn build
	```

	This command gathers the static content and places them in a `build` directory; which is compatible with most static content hosting services.

* Serve the website:

	```
	yarn serve
	```

	This command builds the site and serves it on your machine's host (http://localhost:3000).
