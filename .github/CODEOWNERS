# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.


# The folders are ordered as follows:

# Dev/API:
