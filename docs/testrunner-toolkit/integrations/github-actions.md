These examples can apply to virtually any GitHub deployment, provided that you already have some existing automated tests, and are either the maintainer or an admin of the target repository.

## What You'll Need

* [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
* [Sauce Labs Account](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)
* The following permissions in GitHub:
    * ability to create and manage workflows
    * ability to create and store [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

## Create GitHub Secrets

The first order of business is to export your [Sauce Labs account credentials](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) and store them as GitHub Secrets.

1. Navigate to your project repository and select the __settings__ icon

    <img src={useBaseUrl('img/stt/github-settings.png')} alt="GitHub Settings" width="500" />

2. Select __Secrets__
3. Click the __New secret__ button
4. Add the following:
    * Name: `SAUCE_USERNAME`
    * Value: 'your-sauce-username'
5. Click __Add secret__ to finish.
6. Repeat the same steps above for your `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` (Not sure where to find `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` in Sauce Labs? They're [here](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)).

## Configure the GitHub Action

In your root project directory, create the following directory tree: `.github/workflows`. In the `workflows` directory create a file called `actions.yml`.

Add the following to the top of your file:

:::note
Setting `env` at the top of the file enables it globally in this workflow, so all jobs have access to these variables.
:::

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-cypress-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L3-L13
```

## Create the Test Job

In the examples below, we illustrate the different run modes that `saucectl` has: __Docker__ and the __Sauce Cloud__â€” both determine where tests execute. Docker refers to executing tests locally in a container, while Sauce refers to executing tests on Sauce Cloud (i.e. Sauce Labs infrastructure).
If you run your tests on the Sauce Cloud, you will likely require a tunnel back to where your app is running. A tunnel enables the remote browser to access your local network.
For this, we are going to use [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect).

:::note
For more detailed information on setting event-driven actions and jobs, please visit the [GitHub Action documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions#the-components-of-github-actions).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Docker"
  values={[
    {label: 'Docker', value: 'Docker'},
    {label: 'Sauce Cloud', value: 'Sauce Cloud'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Docker">

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-cypress-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L21-L25
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sauce Cloud">

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-cypress-example/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml#L27-L31
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You can reference our example workflows [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-cypress-example/tree/master/.github/workflows).
:::

Now when you commit these files, GitHub will detect the new workflow actions and launch `saucectl` to run your tests.

To see the output:

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Navigate to your repository page
3. Click on Actions

    <img src={useBaseUrl('img/stt/github-actions.png')} alt="GitHub Actions" width="500" />

Your output may look something like this:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/stt/github-workflow.png')} alt="GitHub Workflow" width="800" />
