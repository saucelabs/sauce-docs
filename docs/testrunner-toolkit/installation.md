Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit is a containerized testing solution that simplifies user setup, speeds up test execution time and supports native Javascript frameworks like, [Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) and [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/), for running end-to-end web tests with [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).

## What You'll Need

* A [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) account (if you don't have one, start a [free trial](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    :::note
    Ensure the [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/) is running (e.g. `docker info` works in your terminal / command prompt)
    :::
* Know which [test framework and browser versions](/testrunner-toolkit#supported-frameworks-and-browsers) you plan to run tests against

### System Requirements

The system requirements to successfully run `saucectl` vary depending on whether you plan to run it locally via [`docker`](/testrunner-toolkit/running-tests#run-your-first-test), or remotely via [`sauce`](/testrunner-toolkit/running-tests#test-on-sauce-labs).

As a rule of thumb, your local system requirements should match the [Docker installation requirements](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms). Please use the reference below as a quick reference:

:::note
Browser support depends on the chosen test framework, see [supported frameworks and browsers](/testrunner-toolkit#supported-frameworks-and-browsers) for more details.

## Installing Testrunner Toolkit

There are multiple ways to install the Sauce Labs Testrunner Toolkit (colloquially known as `saucectl`):

* ```bash title="Using curl"
  curl -L https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install | bash
  ```

* ```bash title="Using NPM"
  npm install -g saucectl
  ```

* ```bash title="Using NPM and SAUCECTL_INSTALL_BINARY"
  SAUCECTL_INSTALL_BINARY=https://company.domain.com/saucectl_0.32.2_mac_64-bit.tar.gz npm install -g saucectl
  ```
Use the `SAUCECTL_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable to make `saucectl` available from a known source within your control or if you use `npx saucectl` to bypass installation.

* ```bash title="Using Homebrew (macOS)"
  brew tap saucelabs/saucectl
  brew install saucectl
  ```

If you would like to inspect the content of our one line installer, download it, have a look, and execute it:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_saucectl.sh https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install && \
chmod 700 get_saucectl.sh && \
./get_saucectl.sh
```

:::caution Are you using mingw?
Mingw on Windows is known to interfere with `saucectl`, especially with interactive commands like `saucectl configure` or `saucectl new`.
We therefore advise Windows users to simply use `cmd` or `powershell` when interacting with `saucectl`.

## Connecting to Sauce Labs

Your Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` are required to post your test results to the Sauce Labs platform. You can obtain your credential values from the [User Settings](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) page in the Sauce Labs app.


### Using Environment Variables

For your convenience, consider setting your account credentials as environment variables. From the root of your project directory, enter the following:

```bash
SAUCE_USERNAME='valid.username'
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY='valid.key'
```

:::warning Protect your Credentials
If you are using a cloud CI/CD tool, we strongly suggest protecting these values through secrets or context variables.
:::

For detailed instructions on how to set environment variables:
* [Set Environment Variables with Windows 10](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
* [Set Environment Variables with MacOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)
* [Set Environment Variables with Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)


### Using the Configure Command

Testrunner Toolkit generally does a good job of detecting the presence of `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`, but to ensure you're properly authenticated, you can run the following optional command:

```bash
saucectl configure
```

This command prompts you to manually enter your credentials if it cannot detect any environment variables, then generates a `credentials.yml` file in a `.sauce` directory in your home folder.

:::warning Protect your Credentials
Add `credentials.yml` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure your credentials are not exposed in your commits.
:::

### Training

See the tutorial and video on [setting up your Testrunner Toolkit environment](https:/training.saucelabs.com/testrunner/index.html) for more help.

## Create a Configuration File

:::tip
If you already have existing tests, skip ahead to the [Running Tests](/testrunner-toolkit/running-tests) section.
:::

Follow the steps below to generate the following assets in your project's root directory:

* a config file (e.g. `.sauce/config.yml`)
* the `tests` directory and other necessary files (e.g. `cypress.json` and `cypress/`)
* an example test (e.g. `cypress/integration/example.test.js`)

1. Run the following command to generate a config file:
    ```bash
    saucectl new
    ```
1. At the prompt, specify your framework:
    ```
    ? Choose a framework:
    ❯ Cypress
      Playwright
      Puppeteer
      TestCafe
    ```

1. Specify your [Sauce Labs data center](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Data+Center+Endpoints) at the next prompt:
    ```
    ? Choose a framework: Cypress
    ? Choose the sauce labs region:
    ❯ us-west-1
      eu-central-1
    ```

The configuration script confirms your setup and prompts you to execute the `saucectl run` command to begin testing.
