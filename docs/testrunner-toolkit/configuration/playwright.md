`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your Playwright tests, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running Playwright tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](/testrunner-toolkit/ide-integrations/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::


## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-playwright-example/blob/master/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running Playwright tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```
---

## `kind`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: playwright
```
---

## `defaults`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any default settings for the project.

```yaml
defaults:
  mode: sauce
  timeout: 15m
```
---

### `mode`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Instructs `saucectl` run tests remotely through Sauce Labs (`sauce`) or locally on `docker`. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `mode` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `sauce`.

```yaml
  mode: sauce
```
---

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long (in `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`) `saucectl` should wait for each suite to complete. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `timeout` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `0` (unlimited).

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

## `sauce`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    name: Testing Playwright Support
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  concurrency: 10
```
---

### `region`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

```yaml
  region: eu-central-1
```
---

### `metadata`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps you distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: Testing Playwright Support
  build: RC 10.4.a
  tags:
    - e2e
    - release team
    - beta
    - featurex
```
---

### `concurrency`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the maximum number of suites to execute at the same time. If the test defines more suites than the max, excess suites are queued and run in order as each suite completes.

:::caution
For tests running on Sauce, set this value to equal or less than your Sauce concurrency allowance, as setting a higher value may result in jobs dropped by the server.
:::

```yaml
  concurrency: 5
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the concurrency flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --ccy 5
```
---

### `retries`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of times to retry a failed suite.

```yaml
  retries: 1
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the retries flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --retries 1
```
---

### `tunnel`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT | <span class="highlight sauce-cloud">Sauce Cloud only</span> |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/testrunner-toolkit/configuration#sauce-connect) to establish a secure connection when running your tests on Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the identifier in this property.

:::note Choose the Correct Tunnel Identifier
When you launch a tunnel, you can accept the tunnel identifier name that Sauce Labs generates for your account (e.g., `{SL-username}_tunnel_id`) or specify a name in the launch command:

```
bin/sc -u {SL-username} -k {SL-access_key} -i {tunnel_identifier}
```

This is the identifier `saucectl` expects as the `id` property, even though the Sauce Labs UI refers to this values as the `Tunnel Name`.
:::

```yaml
 tunnel:
    id: your_tunnel_id
    parent: parent_owner_of_tunnel # if applicable, specify the owner of the tunnel
```
---

## `env`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that are global for all tests suites in this configuration. Expanded environment variables are supported. Values set in this global property will overwrite values set for the same environment variables set at the suite level.

```yaml
  env:
    hello: world
    my_var: $MY_VAR
```
---

## `docker`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |<span class="highlight docker">Docker only</span> |</small></p>

The set of properties defining the specific Docker image and type your are using, if you are running any tests locally.

```yaml
docker:
  fileTransfer: copy
  image: saucelabs/stt-playwright-node:vX.X.X
```
---

### `fileTransfer`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Method in which to transfer test files into the docker container. Valid values are:
* `mount`: (Default) Mounts files and folders into the docker container. Changes to these files and folders will be reflected on the host (and vice a versa).
* `copy`: Copies files and folders into the docker container. If you run into permission issues, either due to docker or host settings, `copy` is the advised use case. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) for more about the copy convention.

```yaml
  fileTransfer: copy
```
---

### `image`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies which docker image and version to use when running tests. Valid values are in the format:
`saucelabs/<framework-node>:<vX.X.X>`. See [Supported Testing Platforms](/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright#supported-testing-platforms) for Docker release notes related to Playwright.

```yaml
  image: saucelabs/< stt-playwright-mocha-node | stt-playwright-node | stt-testcafe-node >:< vX.X.X >
```

:::caution
Avoid using the `latest` tag for docker images, as advised in [this article](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/#:~:text=You%20should%20avoid%20using%20the,apart%20from%20the%20image%20ID.).
:::
---

## `rootDir`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The directory of files that need to be bundled and uploaded for the tests to run. Ignores what is specified in `.sauceignore`. See [Tailoring Your Test File Bundle](#tailoring-your-test-file-bundle) for more details. The following examples show the different relative options for setting this value.

```yaml
  rootDir: "./" # Use the current directory
```

```yaml
  rootDir: "packages/subpackage" # Some other package from within a monorepo
```

:::caution
Only the files contained within `rootDir` will be available during the tests. Any reference to a file that is not included in `rootDir` will make the tests fail.
:::

---

## `npm`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A parent property specifying the configuration details for any `npm` dependencies. Packages listed are installed in the environment prior to your tests executing.

```yaml

    platformName: "Windows 10"
```
---

### `screenResolution`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING | <span class="highlight sauce-cloud">Sauce Cloud only</span> |</small></p>

Specifies a browser window screen resolution, which may be useful if you are attempting to simulate a browser on a particular device type. See [Test Configurations](/basics/test-config-annotation/test-config) for a list of available resolution values.

Sets the number of separate shards to create for the test suite. Read more about shard tests on the [Playwright developer site](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#shards).

When sharding is configured, `saucectl` automatically creates the sharded jobs based on the number of shards you specify. For example, for a suite that specifies 2 shards, `saucectl` clones the suite and runs shard `1/2` on the first suite, and the other shard `2/2` on the identical clone suite.


```yaml
  numShards: 2
```
---

### `params`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

      headful: false
      slowMo: 1000
```

__Description__: This field is for specific test run parameters, for example:
* `browserName` ( *string* ) : the browser in which to run tests
* `headful` ( *boolean* ) : whether to run browsers in headless mode
* `sloMo` ( *int* ) : whether to implement artificially slow load times in milliseconds


#### `browserName`

Determines whether to run the test suite in [headless](/headless) mode.

```yaml
    headful: false
```
---

#### `sloMo`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Allows you to alter the test execution speed for the test suite in milliseconds, to simulate different network connectivity or other conditions that may impact load times.

```yaml
    sloMo: 1000
```
---

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, potentially overriding the default project timeout setting.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

## Advanced Configuration Considerations

The configuration file is flexible enough to allow for any customizations and definitions that are required for any of the supported frameworks. The following sections describe some of the most common configurations.

### Tailoring Your Test File Bundle

The `saucectl` command line bundles your root directory (`rootDir` parameter of `config.yml`) and transmits it to the Sauce Labs cloud or your own infrastructure via Docker, then unpacks the bundle and runs the tests. This functionality is partly what allows Sauce Control to operate in a framework-agnostic capacity. However, you can and should manage the inclusion and exclusion of files that get bundled to optimize performance and ensure security.

#### Excluding Files from the Bundle

The `.sauceignore` file allows you to designate certain files to be excluded from bundling.

Add any files that are not direct test dependencies to `.sauceignore` to reduce the size of your bundle, improve test speed, and protect sensitive information.

Examples of what can be included in `.sauceignore`:

```bash
# .sauceignore

# Ignore node_modules
node_modules/

# Ignore all log files
*.log

# Ignore executables/binaries
*.exe
*.bin
**/*/bin

# Ignore media files
*.png
*.jpeg
*.jpg
*.mp4

# Ignore documentation
*.rst
*.md

# Ignore sensitive data
credentials.yml
```

#### Including Node Dependencies

The default `.sauceignore` file lists `node_modules/` so locally installed node dependencies are excluded from the bundle. If your tests require node dependencies to run, you can either:

* [Include `node_modules` with your bundle](#remove-node_modules-from-sauceignore) or
* [Set NPM packages in config.yml](#set-npm-packages-in-configyml)

#### Remove "node_modules" from `.sauceignore`

Delete or comment out `node_modules/` in your `.sauceignore` file to bundle your node dependencies. For example,

```bash
# Do NOT exclude node_modules from bundle
# node_modules/
```

Node dependencies can increase your bundle by potentially hundreds of megabytes, so consider including only the required dependencies rather than the entire `node_modules` directory. The following sections provide some methods for limiting the scope of dependencies you must include.

##### Install "devDependencies" Only

Consider only installing NPM `devDependencies` if your tests do not require all prod `dependencies`.

```bash
# Only install dev dependencies
npm install --only=dev

saucectl run
```

##### Uninstall Nonessential Dependencies

If your standard install includes dependencies that aren't needed to run your tests, uninstall them prior to bundling.

```bash
# Install node dependencies
npm ci # or "npm install"

# Remove unneeded dependencies
npm uninstall appium
npm uninstall express

saucectl run
```

##### Install Essential Dependencies Individually

If you know that your tests require only specific dependencies, install them individually instead of running `npm install` or `npm ci`.

```bash
# Install individual dependencies
npm install playwright-xpath
npm install @playwright/react

saucectl run
```

#### Set NPM Packages in `config.yml`

You can avoid installing or uninstalling dependencies prior to each bundling operation by defining a default set of NPM packages to install in your sauce configuration file using the `npm` parameter, as shown in the following example:

```jsx title= "config.yml npm example"
npm:
  registry: https://registry.npmjs.org
  packages:
    lodash: "4.17.20"
    "@babel/preset-typescript": "7.12"
    "@playwright/react": "^5.0.1"
```
