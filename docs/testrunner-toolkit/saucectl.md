The `saucectl` command line interface orchestrates the relationship between your tests in your framework, and the rich parallelization, test history filtering, and analytics of Sauce Labs. This page defines each of the commands and flags available in the CLI to allow you to execute your tests with precision.

See [Installation and Setup](/testrunner-toolkit/installation) for installation options.


## `$ saucectl init [flags]`

A bootstrapping command to generate a configuration file for the framework of your choice in the format required by `saucectl`. Running the command with no parameters initiates interactive mode, prompting you for relevant property values iteratively. Alternatively, you can add supported parameters inline to specify the relevant property values.

In either case, the command generates a `.sauce/config.yml` folder and file in the location from which the command is run. If you have an existing project directory for your framework, it is advised that you run this command from the project root.

```bash title="Interactive Example"
$ saucectl init
12:13:20 INF Start Init Command
? Select region: us-west-1
? Select framework:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> cypress
 playwright
 puppeteer
 testcafe
 espresso
 xcuitest
```

```bash title="Batch Example"
$ saucectl init -r us-west-1 -f cypress -b chrome
```

`saucectl` supports the following configuration flags as inline specifications.

## `$ saucectl configure [flags]`

Allows you to provide your [Sauce Labs credentials]((https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) for the purpose of generating a `credentials.yml` file that `saucectl` can access to automatically authenticate commands without requiring manual authentication. The `credentials.yml` file is created in a `.sauce` folder in your  home directory.

:::note Environment Variable credentials prioritized
`saucectl` will also detect your credentials as [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables) if you have set them. In fact, if both exist, the environment variable values take precedence.
:::

You can run the `configure` command without flags, invoking it to prompt you for your credential values, or you can supply the values inline using the username and access key flags.

```bash title="Inline Example"
$ saucectl configure

### `--tags <tag1,tag2,...>`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | LIST | VIRTUAL ONLY |</small></p>

A keyword that may help you distinguish the test on Sauce Labs, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you. This flag is not yet supported for mobile real device tests.

saucectl run --dry-run
```
---

### `--verbose`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Enables detailed output during the test run in order to facilitate troubleshooting potential authentication, connection, and/or container issues. This flag does not require a value; including it inline sets it to `true`.

## `$ saucectl completion`

Allows you to generate a completion script for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish` and `powershell` shells.

```

#### macOS

```bash
saucectl completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/saucectl
```

### zsh

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment, enable it by executing the following once:

```bash
$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:

```bash
saucectl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_saucectl"
```

Start a new shell to apply this setup.

### fish

```bash
saucectl completion fish | source
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:

```bash
saucectl completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/saucectl.fish
```

### PowerShell

```bash
saucectl completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

To load completions for every new session, run the following and then source this file from your Powershell profile:

```bash
saucectl completion powershell > saucectl.ps1
```
