Sauce Headless is a container-based, lightweight, and scalable infrastructure solution for testing web apps on headless Chrome and Firefox browsers in our virtual device cloud. Test early in your development cycle on headless browsers to get fast pass/fail data on early pipeline component tests, sanity checks, and pull request tests.

There are a few key differences between setting up Sauce Headless tests versus setting up other [Sauce Labs automated web app tests](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80415923), as described below.


## What You'll Need

<p> <Highlight color="#013a70">ENTERPRISE PLANS ONLY</Highlight> </p>

The [latest version](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=96832863) of Sauce Connect Proxy, if you're using it to run Headless tests.

>**NOTE**: At this time, data from tests run in Headless mode is not available to the [Sauce Insights](/insights) analytics features.

## Setup and Configuration

Sauce Headless provides headless Chrome and Firefox in the three most recent versions and the most recent version of Linux. 

### WebDriver Capabilities
You'll need to set desired capabilities in your test that are specific to headless testing, as shown in this example:

```
saucelabs_headless_chrome": {
      "request_timeout_options": {
        "timeout": 900000
      },
      "globals": {
        "waitForConditionTimeout": 60000,
        "waitForConditionPollInterval": 100
      },
      "use_ssl": true,
      "selenium_port": 443,
      "selenium_host": "us-east1.headless.saucelabs.com",
      "desiredCapabilities": {
        "browserName": "chrome",
        "version": "latest-2",
        "platform": "Linux",
        "javascriptEnabled": true
      }
    },

```

## Language Bindings

You can run Sauce Headless tests in a variety of programming languages and test frameworks. Here are some samples:

## Data Center Endpoints for Headless
The containers used for Sauce Headless testing are hosted in the Sauce Labs East Coast data center, which is entirely separate from our data centers in the West Coast and in the EU. You'll need to connect to the [US-East Data Center](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102704068) to access the web UI, Selenium endpoint, and Sauce Connect Proxy endpoint for headless testing.

The US-East IP addresses should be reachable from your network. If there's an issue, see the Whitelisting for Restricted Networks section of [Sauce Connect Proxy](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/system-requirements).

>**NOTE**: Cross-Browser VMs are not available at this time in US-East.

## Using the Sauce Headless Web UI
Information about your Headless testing jobs is accessible by logging into the headless testing web interface.

* Direct Web Interface Link: https://app.us-east-1.saucelabs.com
* Select **Headless US-East** from the Sauce Labs dropdown menu

If you want to use a Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel for your Sauce Headless tests, you'll need to start it from here in the UI.

## Headless Testing with Sauce Connect Proxy
If you're testing website that's on your local machine or behind a corporate firewall, we recommend using [Sauce Connect Proxy](/secure-connections/sauce-connect).

To use Sauce Connect Proxy in conjunction with your Sauce Headless tests, be sure you have the [latest version](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation) on your machine. You'll need to start a new, separate tunnel from the one used for the Virtual and Real Device Cloud, by connecting to the [Sauce Headless-specific endpoint](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102704068).
