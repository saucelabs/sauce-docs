import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

One of the core features of the Sauce Labs API Testing platform is the ability to create proper **Integration Tests**.

## What You'll Need
* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* An existing API Testing Project. For details on how to create one, see [API Testing Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart/).

## Overview

An Integration test is a test in which you examine a complete flow of calls, simulating what an API consumer would experience. 

Integration testing is critical for creating a strong API testing strategy. An integration test allows you to create end-to-end tests that resemble common user flows. While only testing individual endpoints is a good start, this method will miss a large number of problems that occur when all services need to work together.

Here is a quick guide on how to create one using a token based authentication API.

## Example

Let’s consider an example that only a proper integration test could solve: Company A has an authentication server. This server, when given the proper user credentials, returns an authentication token. This token is required for all other calls throughout the platform’s API environment. Without this first API call, none of the other API calls can work. API Fortress makes it easy to validate the integration, capturing the entire API flow from end to end.


### Step 1 - Getting the Token

First, you need to make a `POST` call to the authorization server.

In this case, the request body is the user id and password. Given proper credentials, the authentication server will return a user token.

Next, use this token to make further calls to the application.

### Step 2 - Setting a Variable

First, assign the token to a variable.  

:::note
Variables are used to store data temporarily for a test.
:::

```text
Var: access_token //the name of the variable
Variable mode: String
Value: ${authPayload.access_token}
```

:::tip
You can use the Sauce Labs API Testing Vault for more permanent variables ([learn more about vault here](/api-testing/vault))
:::

You'll notice that what we are doing here is specifically taking the `access_token` variable in the `authPayload` response, and setting it as `access_token`: the response body from the original post call was saved to a variable called `authPayload`. The key to access the token is named `access_token`, so you may find it by calling `authPayload.access_token`.

:::note
The dollar sign and brackets are necessary when referencing variables so that Sauce Labs API Testing knows to interpret what’s between the brackets instead of using it literally.
:::


### Step 3 - Making Follow-up Calls

Now it is time for the third, and for this example, final step. We’ve made our authentication `POST` call, and then we’ve saved the token to a dynamic variable named “access_token.” 

Let's say that the API has a cart function that requires a user token in order to add items to a cart or view items currently in the cart. Use a `PUT` request to the cart endpoint to update the cart. Use the access token granted by the authentication server to add items to a cart by setting the `token` header to `${access_token}`.

### Further Explanation

As we stated at the start, it is imperative to not just exercise endpoints, but validate that an entire series of services are working. It’s best to do that by writing tests that emulate common and uncommon user flows. A critical part of that work involves creating reusable variables to allow the test to work at any time, with any data.

By making a request for a fresh token at the beginning of the sequence, and then assigning it to a variable, you will know that any time you run this test, you’re doing so with a valid access token, which is automatically being passed to all follow-up calls.

Feel free to keep using the same access token over and over as seen below.

## One More Example

Let's consider another scenario: there's an API endpoint that produces an array of all the available products and another endpoint that shows the details of a specific product based on its 'id'.

```http request
http://demoapi.apifortress.com/api/retail/product 
http://demoapi.apifortress.com/api/retail/product/${id}
```

In a scenario like the above, you can create an integration test and test the interaction between them as well. 

Let's see all the required steps.

### Steps

1. Call the product listing endpoint and assign the response to `productsPayload` variable.

2. Add an `each` assertion and reference the `productsPayload.products` object.

:::tip
In a real scenario where the response contains a lot of products, it could be useful to pick just few of them randomly using `pick(n)`
:::

3. Test the response payload for this endpoint.

4. Add a new `Set (variable)` component to set the `id` variable as every single `productsPayload.product` that is returned. Notice we set the string to `${_1.id}` The system uses `_1` automatically when recognizing a subroutine. Makes it easier when things get into many sub levels.

5. Make a `GET` to the product details endpoint, using our new `id` variable as the _id_ parameter. Variables last through the entire test unless overwritten.

6. Test the response payload for this endpoint.

The full code will be as follow:


```xml
<get url="http://demoapi.apifortress.com/api/retail/product" params="[:]" var="productsPayload" mode="json">
  <header name="key" value="ABC123"/>
