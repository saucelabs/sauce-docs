`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your API tests, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running API tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/ide/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::

## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-apitest-example/blob/master/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running API tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```

---

## `kind`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: apitest
```

---

## `sauce`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
```

---

### `region`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

```yaml
  region: eu-central-1
```

---

### `tunnel`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels/) to establish a secure connection with Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the name and owner (if applicable) in this property.

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

---

#### `name`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies an active Sauce Connect tunnel to use for secure connectivity to the Sauce Labs cloud.

:::note
This property replaces the former `id` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
```

---

#### `owner`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the Sauce Labs user who created the specified tunnel, which is required if the user running the tests did not create the tunnel.


```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

---

### `metadata`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps you distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
metadata:
  build: RC 10.4.a
```

---

## `env`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that are global for all tests suites in this configuration. Values set in this global property will overwrite values set for the same environment variables set at the suite level.

```yaml
  env:
    hello: world
    my_var: $MY_VAR  # You can also pass through existing environment variables through parameter expansion
```

---

## `rootDir`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The directory where tests will be looked for. 

```yaml
  rootDir: "./" # Use the current directory
```

```yaml
  rootDir: "api/tests" # Some other package from within a monorepo
```

---

## `suites`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties providing details about the test suites to run. May contain multiple suite definitions. See the full [example config](#example-configuration) for an illustration of multiple suite definitions.

---

### `name`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

The name of the test suite, which will be reflected in the results.

```yaml
  - name: "saucy test"
```

---

### `env`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that may be referenced in the tests for this suite. Expanded environment variables are supported. Values set here will be overwritten by values set in the global `env` property.

```yaml
  env:
    hello: world
    my_var: $MY_VAR
```

---

### `useRemoteTests`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

Use the tests already stored in Sauce Labs instead of uploading them before execution.

```yaml
    useRemoteTests: true
```

---

### `tags`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

Executes the tests contained in the specified tags. This value is only considered when using `useRemoteTests: true`.

```yaml
    tags: ["contract"]
```

---

### `testMatch`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

One or more paths to the API Testing folders to run for this suite. Regex values are supported to indicate all or certain directory, etc.

```yaml
    testMatch: ["01 Basic Request"]
```
