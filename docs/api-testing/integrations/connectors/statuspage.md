import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

This connector allows you to connect your API Fortress instance with your StatusPage instance. When a test fails the connector will open an incident in StatusPage, the next time that same test runs and passes the connector will resolve the incident in StatusPage.

:::note
This connector does not come pre-loaded out of the box for self-hosted/on-premises, and will need to be loaded separately. To learn how to load the connector into your API Fortress instance [click here.](/api-testing/integrations/add-new-connector)

## What You'll Need
What you will need from your Status page account is the 

* Page ID
* the API key 

Both can be found by logging into your StatusPage account and going to the manage account page. Then click on the tab names "API":
