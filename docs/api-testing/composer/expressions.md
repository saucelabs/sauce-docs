Expressions are fields that reference an item in the test scope. The item can be a variable or an inner value in a data structure, such as a JSON.

## What You'll Need
* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* Familiarity with the [API Testing Composer](/api-testing/composer/).

## Using Expressions

When working with structured data, expression is the path forÂ reaching out a specific element. Most of the time, it's just object dot notation. Most expressions will start with the name of the variable the data is stored in. In this example, we will assume the data has been assigned to a variable named `payload`:

```json
"data":{
  "created_time": "1453198835",
  "images": {
    "thumbnail": {
      "width": 150,
      "url": "https://domain.com/photos/9451802655724661601789699.jpg",
      "height": 150
      }
   },
  "Total-items": 1
}
```

If you want to reach the value of the `created_time` attribute:

```js
payload.data.created_time
```

If you want to check the `width` of the images:

```js
payload.data.images.thumbnail.width
```

### Special Characters

The `Total-items` element is a bit tricky, because the minus sign ( - ) would be misunderstood and treated as a subtraction operation. For this reason, the dot notation would require square brackets:

```js
`payload.data['Total-Items']
```

### XML

The above statements are valid for both JSON and XML. When you have to reference XML attributes, the dot notation is valid, but the attribute has to be written between the square brackets and preceded by the `@`.

Example:

```xml
<HotelList size="2">
    <HotelSummary order="0">
        <hotelId>20160502</hotelId>
        <name>Hotel One</name>
```

If you want to check the `size` attribute, you have to write:

```js
payload['@size']
```

When you are working with SOAP API, the response might look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<soap:Envelope
xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/"
soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding">

<soap:Body>
  <m:GetUserResponse>
    <m:Username>Tony Stark</m:Username>
  </m:GetUserResponse>
</soap:Body>

</soap:Envelope>
```

You'll also need to include the namespace in the expression. In the above scenario, if you want to check the `Username` item, you have to write:

```js
payload['soap:Body']['m:GetUserResponse']['m:Username']
```

:::note
In XML, the root element is the variable itself, so you won't need to reference it explicitly.
:::


### Functions

Expressions can also contain directives to transform the data you are willing to evaluate. For instance:

```js
<HotelList size="2">
    <HotelSummary order="0">
        <hotelId>20160502</hotelId>
        <name>Hotel One</name>
```

```js
`payload.HotelSummary.length'
```

Will count the number of instances of `HotelSummary`.


### Expressions "Everywhere"

Expressions are automatically evaluated in the **Expression** field for logical components, but can also be introduced in other fields, such as "value", with a specific notation.

In this example, we compare the actual size of the collection with the "size attribute", by enclosing the expression within `${ .. }`. The "type" attribute ensures the comparison will happen with a numeric comparator, rather than string.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/assertEquals.png')} alt="assertEquals" />

### Expression Language Extensions

Our API Testing expression language is mostly used to identify a path in a payload or reference a variable. But there's more to it. A number of extensions are available to generate calculated data, determine the quality of a value and so on.

These _extensions_ can be used in any field that can be evaluated, which means in all __expression__ fields, and all the fields where the value is wrapped in the `${...}` brackets.


#### `WSUtil`

This is the main extension. It supports many useful functions.

- **exists(object : Object) : Boolean :** an XML and JSON existence state is different by definition. Use this in an "if statement" if a test should work both with JSON and XML
- **contains(substring : String, object : Object) : Boolean :** returns true whether the string version of "object" contains the "substring" sub-string.

  ```groovy
  WSUtil.contains('banana', payload.fruit.name)
  ```  

- **isInteger(string: String) , isFloat(string: String), isUrl(string: String), isEmail(string: String), isPhoneNumber(string: String), isBoolean(string: String), isArray(object: Object), isMap(object: Object), isCreditCard(string: String) : Boolean :** evaluate the nature of a data item


#### `anyArray.pick(n)`

Given any array, you can ask the system to create a random subset of it. One typical usage is when an iterator would turn out to be huge, and you prefer to cherry-pick a few items. The code will return an array of five random elements off the _artists_ array.

```js
payload.artists.pick(5)
```

A hands on example:

```yaml
- id: each
  children:
    - id: assert-exists
      expression: _1.href
    - id: assert-exists
      expression: _1.id
  expression: payload.artists.pick(5)
```

#### `anyArray.pick()`

Similar to the `pick(n)`, this method will pick one random item off an array, and return it.


#### `N`

Utility functions for numbers.

- **random(min: Int, max: Int) : Int** : generates a random integer number between min and max.

  ```groovy
  N.random(10,30)
  ```

- **random(min: Int, max: Int, quantity: Int) : List :** generates a list of random numbers

  ```groovy
  N.random(10,30,5)
  ```  

#### `D`

Plays with dates.

- **nowMillis() : Int :** returns the current Unix epoch in milliseconds.
- **plusDays(millis: Int, days: Int): Int** : returns the provided milliseconds, plus the provided number of days
- **plusHours(millis: Int, hours: Int): Int** : returns the provided milliseconds, plus the provided number of hours
- **minusDays(millis: Int, days: Int) : Int** : returns the provided milliseconds, minus the provided number of days
- **minusHours(millis: Int, hours: Int): Int** : returns the provided milliseconds, minus the provided number of hours
- **format(millis: Int, format: String) : String** : creates a timestamp with the given format, using the current timezone
- **format(millis: Int, format: String, timezone: String) : String :** creates a timestamp with the given format, based on the provided timezone id
- **format(millis: Int, format: String, offset: Int) : String :** creates a timestamp with the given format, based on the provided timezone offset
- **parse(timestamp: String) : Int** : tries to parse the provided timestamp and convert it in milliseconds. It will use current timezone if not provided

Here's the conversion map for formats:

#### `WSCrypto`

Encryption utilities:
- **md5(input : String) : String** : returns the md5 hash of the input string.
- **hash(input : String) : String :** returns the SHA-1 hash of the input string, hex encoded.
- **base64(action: String, input: String)** : decodes from or encodes into a base64 string. Action can either be `'encode'` or `'decode'`.
  ```js
  WSCrypto.base64('encode','whatever')
  ```
- **sha256(input : String) : String** : creates an hash of input using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- **sha256(input : String, secret : String) : String :** encrypts input with secret using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.
- **hmacSha1(input : String, secret : String) : String** : encrypts input with secret using the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm.
