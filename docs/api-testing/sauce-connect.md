If your APIs exist behind a firewall on your private network, you'll need to use our Sauce Connect Proxy solution to open up a secure trusted connection between your network and Sauce Labs.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* Your Sauce Labs [Username](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) and [Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).
* Have the Sauce Connect Proxy client on your local machine ([download here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/)).
* If you're new to Sauce Connect Proxy, check out the links under [More Information](#more-information).

## Starting a Tunnel for API Testing

1. First, you'll need to create a .yaml configuration file on your local machine.
   * Copy and paste the sample template below into a text editor and save it as a .yaml file. In this example, we'll name it **api-config.yaml**.
     ```yaml title="Sample Template: API Config YAML File"
     ---
     rest-url: "https://api.us-west-4-i3er.saucelabs.com/rest/v1"
     user: "SAUCE_USERNAME"
     api-key: "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"
     vm-version: "v2alpha"
     tunnel-identifier: "YOUR-TUNNEL-NAME"
     ```
   * Substitute the `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` placeholders with your [credentials](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).
   * Although not required, we recommend naming your Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel. Just use the [`tunnel-identifier`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy/#--tunnel-name-or---tunnel-identifier) property to define your tunnel name.
2. Save your .yaml file to the same folder as your Sauce Connect Proxy client. <br/>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/09/sauceconnect-folders.png')} alt="API Testing Sauce Connect folder structure" width="500" />
3. Open your CLI terminal and navigate to the folder where you have Sauce Connect Proxy saved. If it's in the home directory, you'd run:
  ```bash
  cd sc-4.7.1-osx
  ```
4. Start your tunnel by issuing:
  ```bash
  bin/sc -c api-config.yaml
  ```
