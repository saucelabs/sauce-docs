import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The API Testing Composer enables you to quickly generate API functional tests (no coding experience required) and/or code them from scratch. You can reuse these tests as end-to-end integration tests and load (stress) tests. In turn, load tests can be reused as monitors for performance testing.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
- An existing API Testing Project. For details on how to create one, see [API Testing Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart/).

## Creating a Test with the Composer

### Create a Test

1. In Sauce Labs, click **API Testing**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/api-testing-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to API Testing"/>

2. On the **Projects** page:

   - If you have no tests or projects yet, in the **Write your own test** box, click **Use Composer**.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/composer-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Composer" width="700"/>

   - If you have a project but no tests, on the **Projects** page, click **Write your own test**.

   - If your project has tests, click **Create Test** and then click **From Scratch**.

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-create-from-scratch-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the New Test window" width="350"/>

3. In the **New Test** box, enter a test name, test description (optional), and tags (optional), and then click **Create Test**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-create-new-test.png')} alt="New Test window" width="350"/>

:::note
You can use either the **Visual** composer (guides you through building components, with no coding required) or the **Code** composer (requires you to write code from scratch). For this guide, we're using **Visual**.
:::

For more information, see [Input Sets](/api-testing/composer/#input-sets) and [Visual View and Code View](/api-testing/composer/#visual-view-and-code-view).

### Edit a Test

To edit a test at any time, on the **Projects** page, on the **Tests** tab, hover over a test name and then click **Edit Test**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/edit-test-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the test editor" width="300"/>

### Add Test Components

When test components are combined, they act as our test logic. See the following pages for more information about the components types available in API Testing:

- [I/O Request Test Components](/api-testing/composer/io-components)
- [Assertion Test Components](/api-testing/composer/assertion-components/)
- [Logical Test Components](/api-testing/composer/logical-components/)
- [Other Components](/api-testing/composer/other-components/)

#### Add an I/O Request Test Component

To create a simple `GET` request and validate that response is correct:

1. In API Testing, on the **Compose** page, click **Add child component**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/add-component-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Add component screen"/>

2. In the list of component options, click the **GET** component.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the GET request window"/>

3. In the **GET request** window, in the **Url** field, enter `https://api.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/rest/v1/public/tunnels/info/versions`.

This endpoint will return a JSON response body. 4. In the **Variable** field, enter **payload**. This variable stores the response, so it can now be referred to as **payload**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-window.png')} alt="Editing in the GET request window"/>

5. Leave the rest of the fields blank and then click **Save Changes**.

The result should look like the following:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-final.png')} alt="What the GET request should look like" width="600"/>

For more information, see [I/O Request Test Components](/api-testing/composer/io-components/).

#### Add an Assertion Component

1. In API Testing, on the **Compose** page, click **Add child component**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/add-component-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Add component screen" width="600"/>

2. In the list of component options, click the **Assert Exists** component.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/assert-exists-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Assert exists window"/>

3. In the **Assert exists** window, in the **Expression** field, enter `payload.downloads`. This expression checks for the **downloads** field in the json response body.

4. Leave the rest of the fields blank and click **Save Changes**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/assert-exists-window.png')} alt="Confirm changes" width="600"/>

5. The result should look like the following:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/assert-exists-final.png')} alt="What the Assert request should look like" />

For more information, see [Assertion Test Components](/api-testing/composer/assertion-components/).

#### Additional Example

In the following example, the expression checks if the `download_url` value inside the Linux object is a valid URL.

1. In API Testing, on the **Compose** page, click **Add child component**.

2. In the list of component options, click the **Assert Is** component.

3. In the **Assert is** window, in the **Expression** field, enter `payload.downloads.linux.download_url`. This expression checks for the **download_url** field in the json response payload.

4. Leave the rest of the fields blank and click **Save Changes**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/assert-exists-window-2.png')} alt="Confirm changes" width="600"/>

5. The result should look like the following:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/assert-exists-final-2.png')} alt="What the Assert request should look like" width="500"/>

### Run the Test

In the Composer, click **Run**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/run-test-save-run.png')} alt="Save and Run icons in the Composer" width="500"/>

All test runs appear to the right of the Composer, under the test details and environment sections.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-runs.png')} alt="Test Runs in the Composer" width="350"/>

### Review Test Results

To view your results, in the Composer, in the **Test Runs** list, click the name of the test. This will open the **Test Report Details**. For more information, see [Test Outcome Report](/api-testing/project-dashboard/#test-outcome-report).

## Compose a Request Body

There are several ways you can compose a request body in Sauce Labs API Testing, ranging from simple to complex.

:::note
The included examples use the **POST** method, but all examples can be applied to other methods.
:::

### Copy and Paste the Body

In this method, you copy an existing body and paste it into the call.

1. In the Composer, add a `POST` component and enter the URL and all of the required fields.
   - Url (the url of the resource you want to test) - `https://domain/endpoint`
   - Variable (the name of the variable that contains the response) - `payload`
   - Mode (the response type) - `json`
2. Below the **POST request**, click **Add Child Component** and then click **Request Body**.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-request-add-body-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Post body window"/>

3. Use the following in the Post body fields:

   - Content-Type - `application/json`
   - Body (the body required in your call) - `{"method":"post","url":"http://www.testme.com/api/run/test"}`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-body-window.png')} alt="The Post body window"/>

4. Click **Save Changes** and proceed with the test.

### Use Variables in the Request Body

1. In the Composer, add a `POST` component and enter the URL and all of the required fields.
   - Url (the url of the resource you want to test) - `https://domain/endpoint`
   - Variable (the name of the variable that contains the response) - `payload`
   - Mode (the response type) - `json`
2. Below the **POST request**, click **Add Child Component** and then click **Request Body**.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-request-add-body-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Post body window"/>

3. Select the relevant **Content-Type** and enter the following in the **Body** field:

```json
{
 "user": "${user}",
 "password": "${password}",
 "url": "http://www.testme.com/api/run/test"
}
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-body-window-2.png')} alt="The Post body window"/>

`user` and `password` are not directly passed in the body, but they are variables defined in a data set or stored in the vault (or environments).

4. Click **Save Changes** and proceed with the test.

### Use a Variable from Another Call

1. Add the call to retrieve the variable from. The following is an example of a common scenario in which you need to perform a login for authentication and retrieve the authentication token required for the following call.
   - Url (the url of the resource you want to test) - `https://domain/login`
   - Variable (the name of the variable that contains the response) - `payload`
   - Mode (the response type) - `json`
2. Below the request, click **Add Child Component** and then click **Request Header**.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-add-header-nav.png')} alt="Navigating to the Header window"/>

3. In the **Header** window, enter the following:

   - Name - `Authorization`
   - Value (from encoding `username:password` in Base64) - `Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-header-window.png')} alt="The Header window"/>

4. Click **Save Changes**.

5. The response payload from the login call will contain the desired token. Let's use the following as an example response.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/response-token.png')} alt="An example response"/>

6. Save the token as a variable using a `SET` component.

   - Variable (the variable name) - `token`
   - Mode (the variable type) - `String`
   - Value (retrieves the value from the previous payload- `${payload.access_token}`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/set-variable-window.png')} alt="The SET Variable window"/>

7. Once the token has been saved as a variable, add the second call and use that token in the request body.

   - Content-Type - `application/json`
   - Body - `{"token":"${token}"}`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-request-body-token.png')} alt="POST request body"/>

## Using an Object from Another Call

Using an object from another call is a more complex method. Scenarios in which you might use this method include when you need to use an object retrieved from a previous call in the body of a subsequent call.

1. Perform the call you retrieve the object from.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/get-request-window-3.png')} alt="GET request window"/>

The response payload from the call:

```json
  {
    "id":123,
    "items":[
        {
          "id":11,
          "name":"stuff1"
        },
        {
          "id":12,
          "name":"stuff2"
        },
        {
          "id":13,
          "name":"stuff3"
        }
    ]
  }
```

2. In this example, you need the object `items` as the body in the subsequent call. So, as a second call, add a `POST` and enter the following as body:

```json
{
  "items": "${searchPayload.items.asJSON()}"
}
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-body-window-3.png')} alt="POST request body"/>

3. Continue with the test.

## Creating a New Structure to Add as a Body

This method can be used when you need to create a new structure to add as a body, using data from a previous call.

1. Perform the call that retrieves the data you are using. In the following example, using a `GET` returns an array of items.

2. The response payload:

```json
{
   "items":[
      {
         "id":11,
         "price":5.99
      },
      {
         "id":12,
         "price":6.99
      },
      {
         "id":13,
         "price":10.99
      },
      {
         "id":14,
         "price":15.99
      }
   ]
}
```

3. Create the new data structure by adding a `SET` component.

   - Variable (the variable name) - `itemsAvailable`
   - Mode (the variable type) - `Language`
   - Language - `Javascript`
   - Body - `payload.items.forEach(function (item) {  item.currency = "$"; }); return payload;`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/set-variable-window-2.png')} alt="The SET Variable window"/>

4. Add the `POST` and add the new structure as the `POST` request body.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/post-body-window-4.png')} alt="The POST body window" width="600"/>

5. Continue with the test.

## Dynamic Dates

Instead of entering dates as static values, which may need to be updated periodically, you can create dynamic dates.

### Create a Future Date

1. Open the Composer and add a **Set** component.

2. Enter/select the following:

   - Variable (the variable name) - `futureDate`
   - Mode (the variable type) - `String`
   - Value - `${D.format(D.plusDays(D.nowMillis(),35), 'yyyy-MM-DD')}`

     <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/create-future-date-variable.png')} alt="The SET Variable window"/>

   - `D.nowMillis()` - Returns the current Unix epoch in milliseconds.
   - `D.plusDays()` - Returns the provided milliseconds, plus the provided number of days (in the example, 35 days were added to today's date).
   - `D.format()` - Creates a timestamp with the given format, using the current timezone (in the example, `yyyy-MM-DD`).

   ```js
   ${D.format(D.plusDays(D.nowMillis(),35), 'yyyy-MM-DD')}
   ```

3. Invoke the variable in your test.

### Create a Past Date

Follow the steps for [Create a Future Date](#create-a-future-date), but replace the string with the following:

- `D.minusDays()` - Returns the provided milliseconds, minus the provided number of days (in the example, 35 days were subtracted from today's date).

```js
${D.format(D.minusDays(D.nowMillis(),35), 'yyyy-MM-DD')}
```

### Create a Date with a Time Zone

To create a date based on a specified time zone:

- `D.format()` - Creates a timestamp with the given format, based on the provided time zone ID (the example uses the same date as before, but uses `New York` as the time zone).

```js
${D.format(D.plusDays(D.nowMillis(),35), 'yyyy-MM-DD','America/New_York')}
```

### Convert a Timestamp in Unix Time in Milliseconds

To convert a timestamp from a payload response to milliseconds:

- `D.parse()` - Parses the provided timestamp and converts it to milliseconds.

```js
${D.parse(1649094357)}
```

For more information, see [Expression Language Extensions](/api-testing/composer/expressions/#expression-language-extensions).

## Generating Test Data

If your API or test requires random names, emails, or different types of input data, you can generate those directly in Sauce Labs API Testing. You can directly reference the method in your variable, API call, or anywhere in the test where you can enter the `${F.<methodName()>}` syntax.

- `F.fullName()` - Generates a full name
- `F.firstName()` - Generates a first name
- `F.lastName()` - Generates a last name
- `F.emailAddress()` - Generates an email address
- `F.password(<minimumLength,maximumLength,includeUppercase,includeSpecial,includeDigit>)` - Generates a password. By default the values are F.password(8,16,false,false,false). Minimum length is 3 chars.
- `F.creditCardNumber()` - Generates a credit card number
- `F.creditCardExpiry()` - Generates a credit card expiration date
- `F.integer(<min,max>)` - Generates an integer

For the full list of methods, see [Test Data Methods](#test-data-methods).

These methods can be used anywhere you can write a variable, such as inside a Set (variable) or in any part of the request (body, header, param, etc.).

### Set (variable)

Set (variable) allows you to create variables or more structured data.

To create a single variable:

- **Variable:** The name to assign the variable.
- **Mode:** String
- **Value:** The method to use to generate data. For example, `${F.fullName()}` will generate a random full name.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-data-full-name.png')} alt="Full name generation" width="600"/>

To create an array of data:

- **Variable:** The name to assign the variable.
- **Mode:** Data
- **Data:** The JS function for creating an array. For example, `new Array(5).fill(0).map(_ => F.streetAddress())` generates an array with five random addresses.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-data-array.png')} alt="Data array generation" width="600"/>

To create an object of data:

- **Variable:** The name to assign the variable.
- **Mode:** Language
- **Language:** Template
- **Body:** The object to generate with the required methods.

```json
{
   "name":"${F.firstName()}",
   "last name":"${F.lastName()}",
   "address":"${F.streetName()}",
   "profession":"${F.profession()}",
   "mobile phone":"${F.mobile()}",
   "email":"${F.emailAddress()}"
}
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-data-personal-data.png')} alt="Personal data generation" width="600"/>

### Body

Any of the following methods can be used in a request body.

- **Content-Type:** The content-type of the body (application/json in this example).
- **Body:** The body of the request.

```json
{
  "name": "${F.firstName()}",
  "last name": "${F.lastName()}",
  "city": "${F.city()}",
  "profession": "${F.profession()}"
}
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-data-request-body.png')} alt="Request body data" width="600"/>

In this example we use a POST body, but this can be applied in all REST methods. Similarly, these methods can also be used as params.

- **Name:** The name of the param.
- **Value:** The value of the param. For example, `${F.creditCardNumber()}`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/test-data-request-body-param.png')} alt="Request body param data" width="600"/>

These examples are of the most common places where you may need to generate data, but these methods can be added anywhere you can use a variable.

### Test Data Methods

#### Addresses and Countries

- `F.streetName()` - Generates a street name
- `F.streetAddressNumber()` - Generates an address number

- `F.decimal(<min,max,maxdecimals>)` - Generates a decimal number. For example, `integer(0,2,2)`
- `F.uuid()` - Generates a unique identifier

#### Boolean

- `F.bool()` - Generates a boolean value

## Integration Tests

Integration testing is critical for creating a strong API testing strategy. An integration test allows you to create end-to-end tests that resemble common user flows. While only testing individual endpoints is a good start, this method will miss a large number of problems that occur when all services need to work together.

### Token-based Authentication API

Company A has an authentication server. This server, when given the proper user credentials, returns an authentication token. This token is required for all other calls throughout the platform’s API environment. Without this first API call, none of the other API calls can work.

1. To get the token, make a `POST` call to the authorization server.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-getting-token.png')} alt="POST request to authentication server" width="600"/>

The request body is the user ID and password. Given proper credentials, the authentication server will return a user token.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-token.png')} alt="The user token" width="400"/>

Use this token to make further calls to the application.

2. Add a `Set (variable)` component by entering/selecting the following in the Composer:

   - Variable (the variable name) - `access_token`
   - Mode (the variable type) - `String`
   - Value - `${authPayload.access_token}`

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-assign-token.png')} alt="Setting the variable"/>

This step takes the `access_token` variable in the `authPayload` response, and sets it as `access_token`; the response body from the original post call was saved to a variable called `authPayload`. The access key for the token is `access_token`, which can be found by calling `authPayload.access_token`.

:::note
The dollar sign and brackets are necessary when referencing variables so that Sauce Labs API Testing knows to interpret what’s between the brackets instead of using it literally.
:::

Variables are used to store data temporarily for a test, but you can use the Sauce Labs API Testing Vault for permanent variables. For more information, see [Creating Reusable Variables and Snippets with the Vault](/api-testing/vault)).

3. Make follow-up calls.

In the following example, the API has a cart function that requires a user token to add items to a cart or view items currently in the cart. Use a `PUT` request to the cart endpoint to update the cart. Use the access token granted by the authentication server to add items to a cart by setting the `token` header to `${access_token}`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-set-token-header.png')} alt="Setting the token header"/>

You can also reuse access tokens:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-reuse-tokens.png')} alt="Reusing tokens" width="600"/>

### Test Interactions between Endpoints

In the following example, there is an API endpoint that produces an array of all the available products and another endpoint that shows the details of a specific product based on its ID.

```http request
http://demoapi.apifortress.com/api/retail/product
http://demoapi.apifortress.com/api/retail/product/${id}
```

To create an integration test to test the interaction between the endpoints:

1. Call the product listing endpoint and assign the response to the `productsPayload` variable.

2. Add an `each` assertion and reference the `productsPayload.products` object.

:::note
In a scenario in which the response contains many products, it may be useful to pick a few at random by using `pick(n)`.
:::

3. Test the response payload for the endpoint.

4. Add a new `Set (variable)` assertion to set the `id` variable as every single `productsPayload.product` that is returned. In the following example, the string is `${_1.id}`. The system uses `_1` automatically when recognizing a subroutine, which makes it easier when there are multiple sub-levels.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-test-endpoints.png')} alt="Testing interactions between endpoints" width="600"/>

5. Create a **`GET` request** to the product details endpoint, using the new `id` variable as the **id** parameter. Variables last through the entire test unless overwritten.

6. Test the response payload for the endpoint.

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/int-test-response-payload.png')} alt="Testing the response payload"/>

## Testing Metrics

An HTTP response is made of a payload, but also contains contextual information. You can use Sauce Labs API Testing to test the entire response envelope.

When you're making an HTTP request in the composer, you're providing a variable name. That variable will host the entire response payload. For example, if `payload` is the name of that variable, when the operation completes, another variable called `<variable_name>_response` is also created.

Therefore various pieces of information such as HTTP header and metrics are contained in the variable `payload_response`.

By referencing the `payload_response.statusCode` expression you can access the status code.

### Example

In this example, you want to run a branch of code when the status code is `400`:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/metrics-testing-example.png')} alt="Testing metrics - example" width="600"/>

You can use multiple `if` conditions to check the status codes you need to check, which can be helpful when creating positive and negative tests.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/metrics-mult-if-cond.png')} alt="Using multiple if conditions" width="600"/>

### Example

To check that a resource shouldn't be cached:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/metrics-resource-not-cached.png')} alt="Checking that a resource shouldn't be cached" width="600"/>

### Performance Metrics

You can create specific assertions to verify performance metrics.

#### Example

The following are examples in **Code** view.

```yaml
- id: assert-less
  expression: payload_response.metrics.latency
  value: 350
- id: assert-less
  expression: payload_response.metrics.fetch
  value: 350
- id: assert-less
  expression: payload_response.metrics.overall
  value: 450
```

- `latency` is the time to first byte.
- `fetch` is the total download time of the payload.
- `overall` is fetch and latency combined.

The following is the `overall` example, but in **Visual** view:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/api-testing/metrics-assert-less-visual.png')} alt="An Assert-Less component in Visual view" width="600"/>

### Improving Metrics

The performance of the API can be mission critical in some cases, and cataloging metrics can be as important as collecting them.

The classic approach of creating big tables of HTTP hits with the actual URL being called (and its performance) is certainly accurate, but it's far from being easy to review because URLs contain variables and hardly represent what the action was about.

Sauce Labs API Testing, as a default, works in this classic way, but also gives you the ability to change the footprint of requests based on your organization needs.

#### Example

The following example includes a route with a parameter:

```http request
http://www.whereever.com/[id]/details
```

Each individual `REST` run for this route will produce a new line in the metrics view:

```http request
http://www.whereever.com/1/details
http://www.whereever.com/2/details
http://www.whereever.com/3/details
http://www.whereever.com/4/details
...
```

To produce a single endpoint for reporting from each one of these calls, you can use a [footprint](/api-testing/composer/io-components/#config).

## Terminology

### Visual View and Code View

This toggle switches between the Visual and Code views in the Composer. You can make calls and add assertions for testing your APIs, and insert variables wherever needed. You can use either, depending on which you're more comfortable with.

#### Visual View

Guides you through creating API tests using automated real-time suggestions via predictive text. No coding experience is required.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/visualView.png')} alt="Test Composer Visual view"/>

#### Code View

Enables you to write tests here from scratch, if you feel more comfortable working in code.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/codeView.png')} alt="Test Composer Code view"/>

### Add Child Component

This button displays all available [assertion components](/api-testing/composer/assertion-components/), [I/O components](/api-testing/composer/io-components/), and [logical components](/api-testing/composer/logical-components/).<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/add-component-nav.png')} alt="Add Component"/>

If a component is not valid for the operation you are conducting, it will not be made available to help avoid mistakes. For instance, if you don’t add a `POST` first, you cannot add a `POST` Body or `POST` Param.

:::note
Sauce Labs free trials may not give you access to all available components.

### Component Options

Click **Edit** to modify an existing component, or use the dropdown menu next to **Edit** to perform the actions shown below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/deleteComponent.png')} alt="Component Options"/>

### Save

Saves your progress.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/saveTest.png')} alt="Save"/>

### Publish

Publishes your test.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/publishtest.png')} alt="Publish"/>

### Clear

Clears the most recent unpublished changes made to your test.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/cleartest.png')} alt="Clear"/>

### Run

Executes a test.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/runTest.png')} alt="Run"/>

### Input Sets

Displays the Input Set view where you can store input data sets to reuse within the specific test you're working on.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/inputSets.png')} alt="Input Sets" width="500"/>

There are two types of input data sets you can use:

- Global Parameters - Variables that are available within a test, valid for that specific test only.
- Input Set - Group of input variables representing a scenario, valid for that specific test only. The test will be executed once for each input set, overriding the variable values into your test.

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Input Set with Visual View</strong></td>
<td> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/inputVisual.png')} alt="Input Set Visual View"/> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Input Set with Code View</strong></td>
<td><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/inputCode.png')} alt="Input Set Code View"/> </td>
</tr>
</table>

### Unit View

These buttons switch between the Input Set and Unit views.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/unitView.png')} alt="Unit View"/>

## Test Options

Once you've generated your tests in the Composer, you can manage them from the **Tests** tab. In your project, on the **Tests** tab, hover your mouse over the test line item. You'll see icons that allow you to edit, run, schedule, or delete a test.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/scheduleIcons.png')} alt="Schedules Icons"/>

- Pencil icon: Edit the test (opens the **Compose** tab)
- Play icon: Run the test manually
- Calendar icon: Open the [test scheduler](/api-testing/schedule-test)
- Trash icon: Delete the test
