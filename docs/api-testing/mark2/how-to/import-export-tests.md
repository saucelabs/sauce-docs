API Fortress makes it very simple to import and export your tests. This is useful when moving tests to another project, making another API Fortress deployment, or sharing with our support team for help.

## Export Tests

After you login to the platform, the flow is as such:

1. Click Tests for a Project (folder) of your choice
2. To download click the circles to the left of the test name
3. Click _Export Selected Tests_

This will download a zip of the tests you exported. See below for a GIF of the process.

## Import Tests

To import a test is as easy as clicking the _+Import Tests_ button next to the _+New Test_ button. See image below.
