The API Testing Dashboard &#8212; accessible from with a Project &#8212; displays metrics, logs, and builds, giving you insight into your tests. It centralizes testing management reporting and facilitates team collaboration.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* An existing API Test. For details on how to create one, see [API Testing Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart/).


## Test Outcome Reports
The API Testing **Test Outcome Report** includes input data details and other useful test information, such as reasons for failure, HTTP request and response status codes.

To learn how to access Test results, see [API Testing Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart). Here's an example of a full report:

#### Session Details
Timestamp, execution type, and metadata about the execution of the test (e.g., _Date_, _Mode_, and _Execution Time_).

#### General Details
Test name, test status (pass or fail), project.

#### Request Component
Shows the specific component that you tested. To view granular details about requests and headers, click **See Stack Details**.

#### Assertions
Gray dot indicates a pass, red dot indicates a fail, and yellow dot indicates a warning.

## Test Logs

To view Test logs:

1. Log in to Sauce Labs, then click **API Testing**.
2. Click on any Project, then click the **Dashboard** tab.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dash-1.2.png')} alt="Dashboard Pic 1.2" width="300" />
3. From **Dashboard**, select **Logs**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardLogs.png')} alt="Dashboard Logs"/>
4. Set desired filters to find the test(s) you're looking for, then click **Apply**. Available filters are: date range, tags, event type, and mode (Monitoring (Scheduled) Tests or On-Demand Tests).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Logs Filters"/>

To view the [Test Outcome Report](#test-outcome-reports/), hover your mouse over a line item, then click the kebab icon (three dots):<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardReport.png')} alt="Dashboard Report" width="500"/>


## Test Metrics

To view Test performance metrics (latency and fetch):

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from [Test Logs](#test-logs).
2. From inside the **Dashboard**, select **Metrics**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/metrics.png')} alt="Dashboard Metrics"/>
3. Set the start and end date filters, if desired.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/metricsFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Metrics Filters"/>


## Test Build Reports

If you have Sauce Labs API Testing integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, you can launch several API tests simultaneously and group them as a build by [passing the `-b <build ID>` flag to the required `apifctl` commands](/api-testing/integrations/apifctl-cicd-integration/#-b-build-id).

Sauce API Testing will group all of the events generated by the testing session under a "build" collector. A build is a collection of test results and metrics, associated with a given build ID.

These test results are collected in the Project Dashboard **Builds** section, located next to the **Logs** (events) and **Metrics**. Each Build is labeled with a status, build ID, date last modified, and number of successful events out of total events in that build.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-testing/dashboard/builds1.png')} alt="Dashboard Builds"/>


From each Build line item, you can click to see a summary report containing the following details:
* **Build ID**
* Date/time **Created**
* Date/time of **Last Update**
* List of **Project(s)** involved in the build
* **Total events**, **Successes** and **Failures**
* List of Tests belonging to that build. Under the **Event Details** column, you can click **Open Report Document** to see the results and metrics for each specific test that has been executed in the build.
