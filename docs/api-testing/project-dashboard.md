After you run an API Test, you can view your results, reporting, and analytics to gain further insight and maximize your testing.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* An existing API Test that's been run. For details on how to create one, see the [Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart/).


## Test Outcome Report
The **Test Outcome Report** includes input data details and other useful test information, such as reasons for failure, HTTP requests, and response status codes.

There are three ways to access it:
* From your Project's **Tests** section, click on any Test line item
* From your Project's **Dashboard** section, click on any Test line item
* From your Test's **Compose** section, in the [right-hand nav](/api-testing/quickstart/#view-test-results).

### Viewing Results
Here's a breakdown of what each report contains:

**Test Report Details**: metadata about the execution of the test, such as Test Name, Project Name, and Mode (Scheduled or On Request)<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/sessionDetails.png')} alt="Test Report" width="400" />

**Outcome** (pass/fail status):<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/outcome.png')} alt="Test Report" width="150" />

**Assertions**: your Test assertions, where a gray dot indicates a pass, red dot indicates a fail, and yellow dot indicates a warning<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/assertions.png')} alt="Test Report Primer Image" width="450" />

**Request Components**: shows the specific component(s) that you tested.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/requestComponent.png')} alt="Test Report Primer Image" width="200" />

**Stack Details**: click this to view granular details about requests and headers.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/stackDetails.png')} alt="Test Report Primer Image" width="150" /><br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/stackDetails-expanded.png')} alt="Stack details" width="350" />


## Dashboard

The API Testing Dashboard &#8212; accessible from with a Project &#8212; displays metrics, logs, and builds, a centralized test management tool that simplifies collaboration and reporting.


### Test Logs

1. Log in to Sauce Labs, then click **API Testing**.
2. Click on any Project.
3. Click the **Dashboard** tab.
4. Select the **Logs** radio button.
5. Select desired filters to find the Test(s) you're looking for, then click **Apply**. Filters include, but are not limited to: date range, mode (Monitoring (Scheduled) Tests or On-Demand Tests), tag(s), and [user] agent.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/logsFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Logs Filters"/>


### Test Metrics

To view Test performance metrics (latency and fetch):

1. Log in to Sauce Labs, then click **API Testing**.
2. Click on any Project.
3. Click the **Dashboard** tab.
4. Select the **Metrics** radio button.
5. Select desired filters to find the Test(s) you're looking for, then click **Apply**. Filters include date range and footprint (the request URL).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/metricsFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Metrics Filters"/>


### Test Build Reports

A *Build* is a collection of test results and metrics associated with a given build ID. To create a Build, you'll need to integrate Sauce Labs API Testing into your CI/CD pipeline, then run multiple tests simultaneously, grouped as a Build, by [passing the `-b <build ID>` flag](/api-testing/integrations/apifctl-cicd-integration/#-b-build-id) to the required `apifctl` commands. Sauce API Testing will group all events generated by the Test session under a "build" collector, and test results are collected under **Dashboard** > **Builds**. To view:

1. Log in to Sauce Labs, then click **API Testing**.
2. Click on any Project.
3. Click the **Dashboard** tab.
4. Select the **Build** radio button.
5. Set the date and/or build ID filters, if desired, to find the Test(s) you're looking for. Then click **Apply**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/builds.png')} alt="Dashboard Builds" width="400"/>
6. Click on any line item below to view a summary report for that Build.<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/builds1.png')} alt="Dashboard Builds"/><br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/builds2.png')} alt="Dashboard Builds"/>
  The report contains details such as the build ID, list of Tests belonging to that build, date/time, Projects involved, successful tests, and failed tests.
7. Under the **Event Details** column, click **Open Report Document** to see the results and metrics for each specific test that has been executed in the build.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/builds3.png')} alt="Dashboard Builds"/>
