The API Testing Dashboard &#8212; accessible from with a Project &#8212; displays metrics,  logs, and build giving you insight into your tests. It centralizes testing management reporting and facilitates team collaboration.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* An existing API Testing Project. For details on how to create one, see [API Testing Quickstart](/api-testing/quickstart/).


## Test Logs

To view Test logs:

1. Log in to Sauce Labs, then click **API Testing** > **Get Started**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/09/landingPage.png')} alt="API Testing landing page" width="500" />
2. Click on any Project, then click the **Dashboard** tab.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dash-1.2.png')} alt="Dashboard Pic 1.2" width="300" />
3. From inside the **Dashboard**, select **Logs**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardLogs.png')} alt="Dashboard Logs"/>
4. Set desired filters to find the test(s) you're looking for, then click **Apply**. Available filters are: date range, tags, event type, and mode (Monitoring (Scheduled) Tests or On-Demand Tests).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Logs Filters"/>

### Test Reports

If you hover your mouse over a line item, then click the kebab icon (three dots), you'll see the option to go to the [Test Outcome Report](/api-testing/test-reports/).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dashboardReport.png')} alt="Dashboard Report" width="500"/>


## Test Metrics

To view Test performance metrics (latency and fetch) within a Project:

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from [Test Logs](#test-logs).
2. From inside the **Dashboard**, select **Metrics**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/metrics.png')} alt="Dashboard Metrics"/>
3. Set the start and end date filters, if desired.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/metricsFilters.png')} alt="Dashboard Metrics Filters"/>


## Test Builds

If you have Sauce Labs API Testing integrated into your CI/CD pipeline, you can launch several API tests simultaneously and group them as a build by [passing the `-b <build ID>` flag to the required `apifctl` commands](/api-testing/integrations/apifctl-cicd-integration/#-b-build-id).

Sauce API Testing will group all of the events generated by the testing session under a "build" collector. A build is a collection of test results and metrics, associated with a given build ID.

These test results are collected in the Project Dashboard **Builds** section, located next to the **Logs** (events) and **Metrics**. Each Build is labeled with a status, build ID, date last modified, and number of successful events out of total events in that build.

### Build Reports

From each Build line item, you can click to see a summary report containing the following details:
* **Build ID**
* Date/time **Created**
* Date/time of **Last Update**
* List of **Project(s)** involved in the build
* **Total events**, **Successes** and **Failures**
* List of Tests belonging to that build. Under the **Event Details** column, you can click **Open Report Document** to see the results and metrics for each specific test that has been executed in the build.

## Email Notifications

Email notifications will alert you when a test starts failing, and notify you again when the test is back in full working order. The incident identifier number, used to track the events, will be the same as the test ID.

To enable this feature:
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
1. Click **Email Notifications**.
1. Enter your email address.
1. Select **Save Changes**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dash-1.5.png')} alt="Dashboard Pic 1.5"/>


:::tip
Use the [Fact component](/api-testing/composer/other-components/#fact) to control the behavior of email notifications. This can be if you're testing in multiple environments.
