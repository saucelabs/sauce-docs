Here we will show you how to copy and paste a test. Before that, it should be noted that this isn't often the right way to go. Take a step back and ask yourself if this is actually the perfect solution. We have specifically built our platform to improve work efficiency. Here are some questions that you should ask yourself:

- Are you looking to do negative testing? You can likely do that in the same test using data sets and the [IF component](https://apifortress.com/doc/if-component/) + [status codes](https://apifortress.com/doc/working-with-the-response-object/).
- Are you looking to run from different environments? No problem [with Presets](https://apifortress.com/doc/environments-and-presets/).
- Do you want to run most but not all of the tests in a specific project? Execute tests [using tags](https://apifortressv3.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/test-run/advanced-run-by-tag). ([example](https://mastiff.apifortress.com/app/api/rest/v3/9f68a3de-d990-43c2-bc84-c4a208e2f3f0362/tests/tag/live/run?sync=true), using a unique webhook and the 'live' tag.)

If you still wish to copy a test, the procedure is as follows. First, enter the project and test. Then click over to the _Published_ version of the test, then the _Copy to Clipboard_ option becomes available.

Click _Copy to Clipboard_ and then browse to the Tests view of the same, or another project. There _Paste from Clipboard_ becomes available.
