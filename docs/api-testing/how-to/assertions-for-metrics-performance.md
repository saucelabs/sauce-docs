We have a [more detailed guide](https://apifortress.com/doc/working-with-the-response-object/) on working with the HTTP response, but wanted to provide specifics on creating assertions against performance metrics.

Here is an example using the CODE VIEW of the code. Please note that _overall_ refers to fetch and latency combined.

```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.latency" value="200" type="integer"/>
```
```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.fetch" value="350" type="integer"/>
```
```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.overall" value="450" type="integer"/>
```
