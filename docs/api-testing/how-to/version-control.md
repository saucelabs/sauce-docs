There are two primary mechanisms for version control in API Fortress. The first is the Publish Test feature, which allows for the pushing of updated test-code to a live version of the test.

The second mechanism for version control is the API Fortress-Git integration. The integration is powered by the API Fortress Post-Receive Git Hook, which can be found [here](https://github.com/apifortress/apif-auto/releases). 

Documentation is located [here](https://github.com/apifortress/apif-auto/blob/master/README.md#post-receive-script-for-git).
