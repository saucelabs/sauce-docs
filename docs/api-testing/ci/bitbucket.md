APIF-Auto, a command line tool that supports automated API Fortress test execution is an ideal tool for executing API Fortress tests in a Bitbucket workflow. 

## Example Script

The pipeline script below serves as a template for creating a stage in your Bitbucket Pipeline for testing your APIs with API Fortress. If you’d like to take a look at the documentation for APIF-Auto, click [here](/api-testing/ci/apif-auto). 

> __NOTE__: It’s important to note that this is an **example** of a Bitbucket Pipeline. Experienced users are free to configure their workflow as best suits their needs.

```yaml
image: python:3.7.3  
  
pipelines:  
  default:  
    - step:  
        caches:  
          - pip  
        script: # Modify the commands below to build your repository.  
          - pip install -r apif-auto-master/requirements.txt  
          - python apif-auto-master/apif-run.py run-all security -S -f junit -o test-results/junit.xml
```

## Explanation

First it's worth mentioning that in this example we have the APIF-Auto files in our Bitbucket repository. Let’s break down what’s happening in the script above:  

- First, we are defining the Docker image for python. We will need this to execute the APIF-Auto python scripts.
- Next, we are setting up the Bitbucket pipeline steps. We are cacheing "pip" so we don't need to load it every build.
- In the "script" section we can see a couple of commands being executed:
    - First is the installing the "requirements.txt" using pip, this will install all the packages defined in the file that are needed to run APIF-Auto.
    - Next we are executing the APIF-Auto tool for running tests. In this example we are executing **all** tests within the project "security" and outputting the results in JUnit to a folder in the repository named "test-results", this is one of the acceptable folder names that Bitbucket will automatically parse for test reports.
    - It is worth mentioning that Bitbucket will automatically parse the ".xml" to display the results in your pipeline.

Here is an example output:

 <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-10-at-9.22.57-AM.png')} alt="BitBucket Output"/>

By using the above workflow, we have a modular method of running API Fortress tests in authenticated mode in our Bitbucket pipeline.
