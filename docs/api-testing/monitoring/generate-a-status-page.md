This may be the easiest doc of them all. Generating a status page is as simple as clicking the Gear icon in the top right corner of the page, and going to the Status Pages section.

There are two options here. _Big Screens_ automatically refreshes itself, so it works really well for TVs or monitors in a DevOps office, for example. This view is only viewable by users registered to your company. _Shareable_ generates a link that gives a snapshot of the API's health at the moment the page is loaded. It can be shared publicly without needing an account with API Fortress.
