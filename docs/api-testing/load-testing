The Sauce Labs API Testing load testing feature allows you to stress your endpoints using an existing functional test. The only scenario in which it doesn’t work is if you are using a test with the key/value store component in it.

The load agents run within your infrastructure.

The first step is running your load test agent. It’s up to you to run all the agents connected to the cloud. To make identifying them easier, you can group them by pool ID, assigning the same ID to more than one agent. A pool ID is an identifier of a group of workers. There’s no limit to the number of agents you can run. The only possible limitations are inherited from your infrastructure.

To run an agent, execute the following command:

```
docker run --rm \
--env SAUCE_URI=wss://<api_domain>/api-testing/ws/v4/loadtesting \
--env SAUCE_AUTH=<username>:<access_key>\
--env WORKER_ID=<worker_name> \
--env POOL_ID=<pool_name> \
--env MAX_VIRTUAL_USERS=<max_virtual_users> \
quay.io/saucelabs/loadtestingjs:latest
```

This command will run the agent in a Docker container, but you can manage them in any infrastructure (for example, Kubernetes).

Only two variables in the command are required: `SAUCE_URI` and `SAUCE_AUTH`; all the others are optional and, if not provided, will be auto-generated. The system will generate random names for `WORKER_ID`, `POOL_ID` will remain empty, and the default value for `MAX_VIRTUAL_USERS` is `100`.

Once you have run the agents, you can continue in the API Testing platform:

1. In Sauce Labs, click **API Testing**.

2. Navigate to a published test or a published version of a test.

:::note
Load testing only works with published tests. If you change a published test, and then run a load test without re-publishing it, the load test will be run on the published version, not the updated one.

3. On the **Tests** page, next to the test you want to run a load test on, click the **Load Test** icon.

4. On the tests page, click **Create Load test**.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/placeholder-image.png')} alt="placeholder" width="400"/>

5. On the **Create Load test** page, enter the relevant information and then click **Save and Run**. See [Create Load Test Fields](#create-load-test-fields) for more information.

### Create Load Test Fields
* Name - The name to assign to the load test profile.
* Description - A description of the test.
* Ramp up - The time the test will take to achieve the maximum engagement. This can be any value (expressed in seconds) less than or equal to the duration.
* Duration - The time to stress your test (in minutes).
* Intensity map - Here you can set up the aggressiveness of the virtual users. Each virtual user will repeatedly execute the provided test. At intensity 100, it will relentlessly start a new cycle right after a cycle is completed. As you lower the intensity, the virtual users will take breaks between cycles. As not all virtual users will complete a cycle at the same time, the breaks will create a more distributed, lower intensity, but same complexity volume of requests.
* Agents - The available agents (pools/workers) and the max virtual users you can set up for each one. This is the only mandatory field without any default, so you need to manually select the agents you want to set up. If these are not set up you will not be able to save or run the test.

If you have saved a load test with an agent that is currently offline, you will see an alert and the system will prevent you from running the test with it. You will see the same alert if you are trying to use the same agent for more tests but there are no virtual users available.

* Virtual users - The number of active users per agent you want to simulate. The value can be any value that is less than or equal to the max virtual users available for that agent. If more than one agent is selected, the lesser virtual users value is the max number of virtual users you can set up. If you try to set more agents than the available you will see an error message.

You can set up multiple profiles for each test, from less aggressive to very aggressive, or with varying durations. The only limitations are those inherited from your infrastructure.

Once you have created and saved a load test, the configuration will be saved for future use. To access a previously saved configuration, on the test page, , as a list, on the page, which you access by clicking on the load test icon from the test list.

The execution of a load test will generate a real-time report that is updated every minute.
To stop a report before it is complete, click the **Stop** button.

### Load Test Report Details
* Outcome - The status of the test:
    * Running - The test is running.
    * Stopped - The test has been stopped manually.
    * Completed - The test is complete.
* Load Test - The name of the load test (assigned at creation).
* Test - The name of the test you are running the load test on.
* Project - The project that contains the test.
* Start - The start date and time of the test.
* End - The end date and time of the test.
* User - The user that executed the test.
* Agents - The agents used to run the test.
* Virtual Users - The number of virtual users for the execution of the test.

The report contains a dropdown that shows all the endpoints the test is calling that you can use to filter to a specific one (the default value shows the data for All the endpoints). For best results, set up footprints to ensure the report is readable. For more information, see [Improving Metrics](/api-testing/composer#improving-metrics).

The first graph shows the response time for all or for a specific endpoint. In the graph, you can see the maximum, minimum, average, and the 90th percentile. Once the test is complete, you can click to if you want to remove one (or more) of them, just click it.





The second graph shows the number of requests and the number of failures.

You can exclude one of the options in the same way as for the first graph.

The last graph shows all the status codes the test has generated, also in this case you can hide the ones you are not interested in by clicking on the related label. Besides the most common status codes, we also show the connection ones that are the “minus something”.
Negative status codes represent connectivity issues:
-1: connection refused
-2: timeout
-3: unknown host




In the same way as all the reports, the report is also stored in the project dashboard in the new dedicated section we have introduced, the load test one.
