import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

If you possess [Postman API Collections](https://www.postman.com/collection/), you can import them directly into API Fortress.

## Importing a Collection

API Fortress has made it very easy to import Postman Collections with the click of a button.

- First, open the _HTTP Client_ via the _Tools_ menu.
- Click the gray _Import_ button at the top of the client.
- Select your Collection file in the popup window.
- Click _Open._
- The routes from your collection are now available in the list of saved requests.

## Importing Postman Environments

Importing a Postman environment is just as simple as importing a Postman collection.

- First, inside of a test, click on the _Data Sets_ button on the left pane.
- Click the orange Postman button.
- Select your environments file from the popup.
- Your environmental variables will now be available in the _Data Sets_ pane.

## Importing Postman Global Variables

The process for importing global variables from Postman is nearly identical to the process for importing environmental variables. The primary difference is where the import is executed.

- First, access the _Vault_ via the _Tools_ menu at the top of any view.
- Select the project that you want to access the variables through, or select the _Global Vault_ if you want all of your projects to have access to the variable definitions.
- Click the _Variables_ button in the specific _Vault_ that was chosen.
- Click the _Import Variables from Postman_ button.
- Select your global variables file and click the _Open_ button.
- Your global variable definitions can now be accessed from the connected project(s).
