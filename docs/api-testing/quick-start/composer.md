The API Fortress Composer offers unparalleled flexibility and ease-of-use with everything at your fingertips to build tests in minutes and eliminate many duplicate tasks. Users of all skill levels may begin using the Composer with little or no training to quickly generate sophisticated functional tests. These tests may easily be reused as end-to-end integration tests and load (stress) tests. In turn, load tests may easily be reused as monitors for performance testing.  

:::note Special Note about End-to-End Tests / Integration Tests

Creating a series of independent tests that:

* each hit one endpoint
* and run in a specific order

isn't a proper testing methodology. 

It doesn't allow for optimal testing of how each API interacts with each other. For that reason, the API Fortress composer is very flexible and allows you to create a single "test" that can handle a series of API calls. 

For example __Search__ > __Add to Cart__ > __Checkout__ can and should all be inside of one smart test, and not three separate tests.

## Visual vs. Code View

Begin using the Composer by selecting from two versions in terms of views. With either Visual or Code view, easily make calls and add assertions for testing your APIs, and insert variables wherever needed.

* __Visual__ - The Visual Composer does not require coding expertise, and provides real-time suggestions via predictive text to help you create ideal API tests for your needs.

* __Code__ - The Code view is for users who are more comfortable working in code rather than a visual UI.

## Test Composer UI

Use the following image as a reference for the numbered items listed below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2019/06/numberpic.png')} alt="Test Composer Number Pic"/>

### 1 - Add Request / Assertions

This is the __Add Request__ / __Assertions__ button, it can display all available components.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2019/06/components.png')} alt="Test Components"/>

If a component is not valid for the operation you are conducting, it will not be made available to help avoid mistakes. 

For instance, if you don’t add a `POST` first, you cannot add a `POST` Body or `POST` Param. 

> __NOTE__: Free accounts do not give you access to all available components.  
> Read descriptions of each component in the Reference section of API Fortress Documentation.

### 2 - Transform  Component

This button allows you to easily transform an existing component into another component of the same type.

### 3 - Input Sets

__Input Sets__ are a group of input variables representing a scenario. The test will be executed once for each input set, overriding the variable values into your test. 

__Global Parameters__ are variables that are available to be used throughout a test. Reference these variables simply by calling it within the test using the convention `“${VARIABLE}”`.

### 4 - HTTP Client

The __HTTP Client__ is very similar to many other `http` clients out there. You can make `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` calls and see their responses. A key difference in our HTTP client comes from your ability to generate a test for the API you are calling right from there. 

If you click the *Generate Test* button, the UI creates a test for you based on the API’s behavior and response. 

See the screenshot below for details:
