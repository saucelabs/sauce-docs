If you have the right level Apiary account (any paid account), you can generate a test from your Apiary docs. It's as simple as a few clicks.

## Directions 

This GIF pretty much explains it, but from the test composer interstitial page, there is a Build from Apiary button. Click it, login to your Apiary account, and choose which Blueprint to create a test from.

Don't forget that this is a test draft. Add more logic to it for a really awesome test. Maybe add more calls to it as well to create a proper integration test.
