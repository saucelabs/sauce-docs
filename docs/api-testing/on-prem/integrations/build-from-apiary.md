> **Legacy Documentation**<br/>You're viewing legacy documentation for API Fortress (deployed via an on-premises container). To view documentation for the new SaaS version of API Fortress &#8212; now known as Sauce Labs API Testing and Monitoring (with Sauce Connect tunnels) &#8212; see [API Testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud](/api-testing/).

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

If you have the right level Apiary account (any paid account), you can generate a test from your Apiary docs. It's as simple as a few clicks.

## Directions

This GIF pretty much explains it, but from the test composer interstitial page, there is a Build from Apiary button. Click it, login to your Apiary account, and choose which Blueprint to create a test from.

Don't forget that this is a test draft. Add more logic to it for a really awesome test. Maybe add more calls to it as well to create a proper integration test.
