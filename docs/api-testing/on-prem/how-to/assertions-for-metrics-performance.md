>**Legacy Documentation**<br/>You're viewing legacy documentation for API Fortress (deployed via an on-premises container). To view documentation for the new SaaS version of API Fortress &#8212; now known as Sauce Labs API Testing and Monitoring (with Sauce Connect tunnels) &#8212; see [API Testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud](/api-testing/).

We have a [more detailed guide](/api-testing/on-prem/learn-more/working-with-the-response-object) on working with the HTTP response, but wanted to provide specifics on creating assertions against performance metrics.

Here is an example using the CODE VIEW of the code. Please note that _overall_ refers to fetch and latency combined.

```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.latency" value="200" type="integer"/>
```
```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.fetch" value="350" type="integer"/>
```
```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.overall" value="450" type="integer"/>
```
