> **Legacy Documentation**<br/>You're viewing legacy documentation for API Fortress (deployed via an on-premises container). To view documentation for the new SaaS version of API Fortress &#8212; now known as Sauce Labs API Testing and Monitoring (with Sauce Connect tunnels) &#8212; see [API Testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud](/api-testing/).

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Generating a status page is as simple as clicking the Gear icon in the top right corner of the page, and going to the **Status Pages** section.

## Walkthrough

There are two options here:

- _Big Screens_ automatically refreshes itself, so it works really well for TVs or monitors in a DevOps office, for example. This view is only viewable by users registered to your company.
- _Shareable_ generates a link that gives a snapshot of the API's health at the moment the page is loaded. It can be shared publicly without needing an account with API Fortress.
