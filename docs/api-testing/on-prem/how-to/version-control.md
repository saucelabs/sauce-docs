>**Legacy Documentation**<br/>You're viewing legacy documentation for API Fortress (deployed via an on-premises container). To view documentation for the new SaaS version of API Fortress &#8212; now known as Sauce Labs API Testing and Monitoring (with Sauce Connect tunnels) &#8212; see [API Testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud](/api-testing/).

There are two primary mechanisms for version control in API Fortress. The first is the Publish Test feature, which allows for the pushing of updated test-code to a live version of the test.

The second mechanism for version control is the API Fortress-Git integration. The integration is powered by the API Fortress Post-Receive Git Hook, which can be found [here](https://github.com/apifortress/apif-auto/releases).

Documentation is located [here](https://github.com/apifortress/apif-auto/blob/master/README.md#post-receive-script-for-git).
