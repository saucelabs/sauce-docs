>**Legacy Documentation**<br/>You're viewing legacy documentation for API Fortress (deployed via an on-premises container). To view documentation for the new SaaS version of API Fortress &#8212; now known as Sauce Labs API Testing and Monitoring (with Sauce Connect tunnels) &#8212; see [API Testing on the Sauce Labs Cloud](/api-testing/).

The one server setup for API Fortress on-premise is a quick way to get things started in a protected environment. While not ideal for availability or performance, works exactly as expected and provides all the features of the cloud version.  


## Minimum Hardware Requirements  
* CPU: Intel based high frequency quad core processor  
* Memory: 16 GB RAM  
* HDD: 250 GB Memory: the memory impacts significantly on the speed of queries on big data sets. 32 GB is a recommended setup HDD: All API Fortress reports and metrics are stored. 10 million reports + 30 million metrics can require up to 250GB of disk space  


## Software Requirements
* OS: a recent Linux distribution  

## Docker Deployment
* Docker: 1.12  
> For the Docker deployment to succeed and to ease further updates, the server has to be able to communicate withÂ https://hub.docker.com  


## Processes
* PostgreSQL: relational database for structured data  
* MongoDB: document database for reports and metrics  
* RabbitMQ: message queue  
* Tomcat: dashboard and engine application  
* AFScheduler: the API Fortress scheduler  
* AFMailer: the API Fortress mailer  
* AFConnector: dynamic data dispatcher for notifications  
* AFDownloadAgent: the downloader agent (actually performing HTTP calls)  

## Networking
We assume this deployment will be able to access the services to be tested.  

## Further Connections
* HTTP(`80`) and/or HTTPS(`443`) inbound traffic enabled for every location that will need access to the dashboards.
* Ports and services may vary based on system requirements.
