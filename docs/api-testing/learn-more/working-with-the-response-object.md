An HTTP response is made of a payload (what you are mainly interested in), but also contains contextual information. Using API Fortress you can also deal with the whole response envelope.

## Overview

When you're making an HTTP request in the composer, you're providing a variable name. That variable will host the entire response payload. So let's say "payload" is the name of that variable. When the operation completes, another variable called `<variable_name>_response` is also created. 

Therefore various pieces of information such as HTTP header and metrics are contained in the variable `payload_response`.

So by referencing the `payload_response.statusCode` expression you can access the status code. For example, if you want to run a branch of code when the status code is `400`, here's how you do it:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2017/03/statusCode.jpg')} alt="statusCode.jpg"/>

You can have multiple 'IF' conditions for checking all the possible status codes you need to check. Very useful for creating positive and negative tests.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2017/03/multiStatusCode.jpg')} alt="multiStatusCode.jpg"/>

Headers are also a big part of the response.

Let's say you want to check that a resource shouldn't be cached:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2017/03/response_headers.jpg')} alt="response_headers.jpg"/>

Furthermore, you can have the performance of the call verified as well. 

## Code View Example

Here is what it looks like in the CODE view:

```html
<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.latency" value="350" type="integer"/>

<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.fetch" value="350" type="integer"/>

<assert-less expression="payload_response.metrics.overall" value="550" type="integer"/>
```

## Visual Composer View
Here is what it looks like in the VISUAL view:

:::tip
Use the Assert-Less component
:::

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2017/03/metric-test-1.png')} alt="metric-test-1.png"/>

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2017/03/metric-test-2.png')} alt="metric-test-2.png"/>
__

:::note 
Latency is defined as time to first byte. Fetch is the total download time of the payload.
