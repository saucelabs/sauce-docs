## Examples

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2020/12/1each.jpg')} alt="1each.jpg"/>

for each 'legs' collection checks if 'vector' item is an integer value.

If a collection is nested in another one, you need to refer to them as `_1`, `_2`, and so on.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2020/12/nestedEach.jpg')} alt="nestedEach.jpg"/>


for each payload.content.flights collection checks if 'price.amount' is an integer and then, for each legs array (that is a nested collection in the flights collection) checks if vector item is an integer value.
