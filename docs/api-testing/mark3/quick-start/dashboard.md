## Accessing the Dashboard

There are two ways to access your API testing dashboard:

1. From the project thumbnail, select the graph icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/graphIcon.png')} alt="graph icon"/>:
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dash-1.1.png')} alt="Dashboard Pic 1.1"/>

1. From the test composer view, select the **Dashboard** tab:
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/api-fortress/2021/02/dash-1.2.png')} alt="Dashboard Pic 1.2"/>

## Test Logs

To view all test logs across a project:
