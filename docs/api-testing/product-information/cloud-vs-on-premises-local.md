:::note
Did you receive an Invalid Request message? It's possible that you are trying to reach an environment that is behind a firewall that our public cloud accounts can't reach. You may need to allowlist our IPs, or install a self-hosted/on-premises trial. Please contact support@apifortress.com to learn more, or use our chat bot._
:::

The API Fortress platform was uniquely developed to function in our cloud, or from your own virtual private cloud or data center. This was to allow for customers that have security requirements that don't allow for use of the cloud version (like private staging environments). The entire platform can be deployed behind your own firewall using Docker, Kubernetes or OpenShift.

To trial cloud simply [register an account](http://apifortress.com/register). To trial self-hosted/on-premises please [fill out this form](https://apifortress.com/doc/on-premises-questionnaire/) and contact sales@apifortress.com to learn more.

## Why Self-Hosted/On-Premises?

There are more details on the self-hosted/on-premises option here, but the main reasons for choosing on-premises over cloud are:

- Self-hosted/On-premises can have access to environments behind firewalls, like staging and preprod.
- Self-hosted/On-premises is unlimited in terms of tests and executions.
- Load Testing and Mocking are currently only available self-hosted/on-premises.
- More control over scheduling, database choices, etc...

A self-hosted/on-premises deployment is simple to do. Please contact sales@apifortress.com and we'll help you get setup.
