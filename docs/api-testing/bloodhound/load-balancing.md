Bloodhound has a simple load balancing capability we are going to discuss now. Before moving forward, make sure you have read the [basic configuration guide](/api-testing/bloodhound/basic-configuration).

## Load Balancing Configuration

The backends in the `backends.yml` can alternatively be expressed as follows:

```yaml
- prefix: '\[^/\]\*/upstreams'
  upstreams:
    urls:
    - 'https://server-1/endpoint'
    - 'https://server-2/endpoint'
    probe:
      count\_up: 2
      count\_down: 2
      method: GET
      timeout: 2 seconds
      path: ''
      status: 200
      interval: 10 seconds
  flow\_id: default
```

In this configuration, `upstream` is replaced by the `upstreams` object.

* `urls`: a list of URLs that will be used as upstreams
* `probe`: the system will probe each URL periodically to make sure they are available. The probe is optional and, if omitted, Bloodhound will always consider URLs as functional.
    * `path`: an extra path segment to be appeneded to the URL when probing
    * `count_up`: how many times a probe should be successful before the URL can be considered as working
    * `count_down`: how many times a probe should fail before the URL can be considered as non working
    * `method`: which method, among `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` needs to be used by the probe
    * `timeout`: how long should a probe wait for a reply before it considers the URL as non responsive and therefore call it a failure
    * `status`: the expected status code
    * `interval`: how frequently should the probe run

> __NOTE__: The system will look for a `probe` thread pool in the `implementers.yml` file. If no `probe` thread pool is defined, default will be used.
