The default Bloodhound configuration module is file driven. All configuration files are located in the `etc` directory.

## System configuration

### `bloodhound.yml`

The `config_loader` section describes which configuration loading mechanism needs to be used. Modules can be created to store and load configuration in other locations and systems, such as databases.

The `mime.text_content_types_contain` array contains a list of substrings meant to help the system detecting which content types are meant to represent textual content.

### `application.properties`

See [Fine tuning](/api-testing/bloodhound/fine-tuning) for more settings.

| Property                               | Description                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `logging.config=etc/logback.xml`       | describes where the logging configuration file is located                        |
| `server.port`                          | tells the Bloodhound web server which port it should bind to (default is `8080`) |
| `server.compression.enabled`           | true if the web server needs to compress its output (default is `false`)         |
| `server.compression.mime-types`        | a comma-separated list of mime types that should undergo compression             |
| `server.compression.min-response-size` | the smallest stream of that should trigger compression                           |
| `server.ssl.key-store-type`            | to configure secure connections, the key-store type (default is `PKCS12`)        |
| `server.ssl.key-store`                 | the location of the `key-store` in the file system                               |
| `server.ssl.key-store-password`        | the password of the `key-store`                                                  |

### `ehcache.xml`

Certain operations may require some short lived caching. This is where that caching happens.

* `configs` is a cache meant to store the system configuration, so that it doesn't need to be read multiple times in a short period of time.
* `expressions` is a cache meant to store the interpreted version of Spring SpEL scripts.
* `api_keys` is a cache used by the default ApiKeysFilterActor to store API keys in memory.
* `http_routers` is a cache used by the load-balancing functionality.

New caches can be introduced to support other modules if necessary.

### `logback.xml`

The configuration of the logging system.

## Proxy configuration

### `implementers.yml`

This is where all actors involved in flows get listed and configured. If an actor is going to be used in a flow, it needs to appear here.

A typical implementer is configured like this:

```yaml
  - id: request
    class: com.apifortress.Bloodhound.actors.proxy.RequestActor
    type: proxy
    instances: 2
```

* `id` the ID of the actor
* `class` the class implementing the actor
* `type` a type among `proxy` `filter` `transformer` and `sidecar`
* `instances` (optional) the number of instances of the actor to be instantiated
* `thread_pool` (optional) the name of the thread pool assigned to this actor

This file also defines thread pools in the `thread_pools` section. Thread pools describe pools of threads to be assigned to actors. A typical thread pool looks like this:

```yaml
  default:
    min: 1
    max: 2
    factor: 1
```

The key of the thread pool (in this case `default`) is a single word that identifies the thread pool. A `default` thread pool is always required.

* `min` is the minimum number of threads created for this thread pool.
* `max` is the maximum number of threads created for this thread pool (the threads exceeding `min` get decommissioned when not in use)
* `factor` is a multiplier that depends on the server Bloodhound is operating on and it works like this `factor*cpu=n_of_threads`. A way to make the system more adaptive to the context.

### `backends.yml`

This file connects the inbound requests to the outbound destinations.

A typical backend looks like this:

```yaml
  - prefix: '127.0.0.1/any'
  upstream: 'https://httpbin.org/anything'
  flow\_id: default
```

* `prefix` how the inbound request will look like, without protocol and port.
* `upstream` where to send the request to. If this field is omitted, the full request URL will be used (useful in conjunction with a forward proxy)
* `flow_id` which flow needs to be used.

:::note
**Everything exceeding prefix on the right side** will be passed over to the upstream. 

In this example, a request sent to:
```http request
http://127.0.0.1:8080/any/whatever
```
is then forwarded to: 
```http request
https://httpbin.org/anything/whatever
```
:::

Optionally, a `headers` filter can also be applied. For example:

__Example 1__:

```yaml
- prefix: '\[^/\]\*/only/with/header'
  headers:
    x-my-header: anything
  upstream: 'https://httpbin.org/anything'
  flow\_id: default
```

__Example 2__:

```yaml
- prefix: '\[^/\]\*/only/with/header'
  headers:
    x-my-header: mastiff
  upstream: 'https://mastiff.apifortress.com/app/api/rest/relay'
  flow\_id: default
```

If the `x-my-header` header is present and is equal to `anything`, the first configuration will be chosen. If the given header is equal to `mastiff`, the second configuration will be chosen.

It is also possible to pass extra meta-variables to the flow when a specific flow is picked up. For example:

```yaml
- prefix: '\[^/\]\*/with/meta'
  meta:
    special\_var: my\_meta
  upstream: 'https://httpbin.org/anything'
  flow\_id: default
```

The meta variables can be retrieved in `evaluated` fields by using the following syntax:

```js
#msg.meta().get('special_var').get()
```
