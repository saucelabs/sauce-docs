## Type: Proxy

### `RequestActor`

This is a special actor and needs to be instantiated with the special id **`proxy/request`**

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.proxy.RequestActor`

**sidecars:** yes

**config:**

- `discard_headers`: a list of request header names that need to be discarded immediately

### `UpstreamHttpActor`

The default upstream actor.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.proxy.UpstreamHttpActor`

**sidcars:** yes

**config:**

- `connect_timeout`: timeout for the connection process in milliseconds
- `socket_timeout`: timeout for silent socket in milliseconds
- `redirects_enabled`: set to true if you want Bloodhound to resolve redirects instead of forwarding to the client
- `max_redirects`: if redirects are enabled, maximum number of redirects before giving up
- `discard_headers`: a list of response header names that need to be discarded immediately

### `UpstreamFileActor`

An upstream actor that pulls content from text files.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.proxy.UpstreamFileActor`

**sidecars:** yes

**config:**

- `basepath`: path to the files directory. The file name needs to be provided in the request url

### `SendBackActor`

An actor taking care of performing the final checks, packaging and sending back the content.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.proxy.SendBackActor`

**sidecars:** yes

## Type: Sidecar

### `AccessLoggerActor`

A logger actor meant to log both inbound and outbound calls. The behavior of the logging activity is managed by the `etc/logback.xml` file.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.sidecars.AccessLoggerActor`

**sidecars:** no

### `GenericLoggerActor`

A logger to be used in a flow to log certain facts, determined by the user. The behavior of the logging activity is managed by the `etc/logback.xml` file.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.sidecars.GenericLoggerActor`

**sidecars:** no

**config:**

- `value`: the content to be logged
    
- `evaluated`: if set to true, the `value` field will be interpreted as a SpEL script. The message is accessible via the `msg` variable.
    

### `FileAppenderSerializerActor`

Serializes a full API conversation to JSON and appends it to a file.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.sidecars.serializers.FileAppenderSerializerActor`

**sidecars:** no

**config:**

- `filename`: name of the file
- `disable_on_header`: if the provided header is present in the request, then the conversation will skip serialization
- `enable_on_header`: if the provided header is present in the request, then the conversation will be serialized
- `discard_request_headers`: list of request headers that should not appear in the serialized conversation
- `discard_response_headers`: list of response headers that should not appear in the serialized conversation
- `allow_content_types`: full or partial response content types which make the request eligible for serialization. If the list is null or empty, all content types will be accepted

## Type: Transformer

### `TransformHeadersActor`

Alters the headers of a message. If the transformer is placed before an Upstream actor, it modifies the request headers. If after, it modifies the response headers.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.transformers.TransformHeadersActor`

**config:**

- `add`: adds a header. If `evaluated` is set to `ŧrue`, the value is treated as a SpEL script. For Example:
   
   ```yaml 
      add:
        - name: header\_name
          value: header\_value
          evaluated: false
   ```
   
- `remove`: removes a header. For Example:
    
   ```yaml
      remove:
        - name: header\_name
   ```
  
- `set`: sets the value of an existing header, or adds it if the header is not present. If `evaluated` is set to `ŧrue`, the value is treated as a SpEL script. For Example:
    
    ```yaml
    set:
      - name: header\_name
        value: header\_value
        evaluated: false
    ```

## Type: Filter

### `FilterActor`

Filters out any request not matching a certain set of criteria.

**class:** `com.apifortress.afthem.actors.filters.FilterActor`

**sidecars:** yes

**config:**

- `accept`: a list of conditions. If verified, the message will be accepted. For Example:
    
  ```yaml
     accept:
       - value: "#msg.request().getHeader('accept')=='application/json'"
         evaluated: true
       - value: "#msg.request().getHeader('key')=='ABC123'"
         evaluated: true  
  ```
    
    Just like previous filters, if evaluated is true,`value` will be evaluated as SpEL script.
- `reject`: a list of conditions. If verified, the message will be rejected. Example:
    
  ```yaml
    reject:
      - value: "#msg.request().method()!='GET'"
        evaluated: true
  ```
