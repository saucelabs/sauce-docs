Auto-update is a feature that allows you to seamlessly push new versions of  your app to users, ensuring that everyone is always using the latest version. By enabling auto-update, users with older versions of the app will receive a notification prompting them to update the next time they use the app.

:::note
Auto-update is not available in production.

## Configuring Auto-Update

There are two ways to configure auto-update for a specific build:

- In Build Settings
- Via Upload API

### In Build Settings

After uploading a build, access the build settings and navigate to the **App Distribution** section. Here, you can select the **Auto-Update** checkbox to enable auto-update for the build.

### Via Upload API

When uploading a new build via the [upload API](/testfairy/api-reference/upload-api), set the `auto-update` parameter to `on`.

### Implementing Auto Update in Your App

To detect if there is a new version, we will be using the `getDistributionStatus` 
method. This method is also used to detect if the current version is still available
for distribution. You can read more regarding [Invalidating Apps](/testfairy/app-distribution/app-expiration/).

```jsx title="Sample Request"
curl -XPOST \
    "https://mobile.saucelabs.com/services/?method=testfairy.session.getDistributionStatus" \
    -F token=$TESTFAIRY_APP_TOKEN \
    -F platform=0 \
    -F bundleIdentifier=com.saucelabs.mydemoapp.android \
    -F bundleVersion=22 \
    -F bundleShortVersion=2.0.1
```

And the response would include the fields "status" and "autoUpdateDownloadUrl" (optional). Like so:

```json title="Sample Response"
{
    "status": "enabled", 
    "autoUpdateDownloadUrl": "https://mobile.saucelabs.com/download/XXXXXXX"
}
```

- `status`: Is the distribution of the current version still allowed? Useful for invalidating specific versions after distribution.
- `autoUpdateDownloadUrl`: Optional string, if available, points to the URL the end user needs to open in a browser.

### Reasons Auto-Update May Fail

Auto-update may fail for the following reasons:

- The version number and name of the new build are the same as the old one. Auto-update only works when versions are different.
- (iOS) The app is not signed with an ad-hoc or enterprise certificate.
- (Android) The sign certificates for each version are different. If an app does not sign with the same certificate, auto-update is rejected. This is because it's impossible to install the new version without previously uninstalling the current one.

### Notes on Security

`getDistributionStatus` is called from within your mobile app. It uses **TestFairy App Token**, which is a public token that cannot be used to make changes on the platform. 

If your app is publicly available for download, the returned URL is for a direct download (only for Android). Otherwise, the returned URL is of a download page, which will require re-authentication before the build can be downloaded. 

Also, note that only 1 build version can be marked for auto-update. This may point to any version, not necessarily a version that the current tester has been invited to. Please plan your auto-update policy.
