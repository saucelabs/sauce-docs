### Manually install and trust an enterprise app

When you first open an enterprise app that you've manually installed, you see a notification that the developer of the app isn't trusted on your device. You can dismiss this message, but then you can't open the app.

To establish trust for the app developer tap Settings → General → Profiles or Profiles & Device Management.

Under the "Enterprise App" heading, you see a profile for the developer of the app you want to trust.

Tap the name of the developer profile under the Enterprise App heading to establish trust for this developer.

You will get a prompt to confirm your choice.

Once you trust this profile, you can install and run any other apps from the same developer. This developer will remain trusted until you remove all apps of this developer.
