TestFairy provides a powerful feature that allows you to log all network requests made by your mobile app. This logging capability facilitates the monitoring of network access, enabling you to identify potential issues, such as **slow requests** or HTTP **4xx** error codes. 

These issues might be challenging to locate manually but can significantly impact user experience. TestFairy will list all network requests on the session page. Fixing these issues will significantly improve the experience for your users.
