### (Optional) Automatically Importing Groups From OKTA

When managing large teams with OKTA, it is most likely that people are already associated with groups.

For example, say Alice is associated with the following groups in OKTA: ["QA", "QA San Francisco"]. With auto-import of groups, Alice is automatically associated with the following groups in TestFairy the next time she signs in: "okta", "okta-qa", and "okta-qa-san-francisco". Once removed from the group "QA", Alice is automatically removed from the "okta-qa" group in TestFairy, the next time she signs in.

To import groups each time a user signs into TestFairy:

1. Open the TestFairy app in your OKTA account, select **Sign On**, and click **Edit**.
1. Click on **Attributes**.
1. Under **Group Attribute Statements**, add a rule with the name: "groups" (in **lowercase**) and filter "Matches regex" with value `.*`. (dot asterisk).
1. Note: We recommend adding at least one **Attribute Statement** (e.g., email), as shown below. Failing to do so may prevent SAML from including group data in the response.
