The TestFairy allows you to integrate it's powerful mobile testing platform into your Unity project. By following the steps below, you'll be able to start using TestFairy to capture valuable insights into your app's performance and user behavior.

## Installation

To integrate the TestFairy Unity SDK with your Unity project, follow the steps below:


1. From the TestFairy Unity SDK GitHub page, download the [latest](https://github.com/testfairy/testfairy-unity-plugin/releases) version of the `unitypackage`.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/unity-latest.png')} alt="download latest"/>

2. In your open Unity project, navigate to **Assets** > **Import Package** > **Custom Package**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/custom-import.png')} alt="custom import"/>

3. In the Import Unity Package window, first click **All** to include the TestFairy SDK in your app. Then click **Import**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/file-select.png')} alt="select file"/>

4. To use the TestFairy Unity SDK, click `mainCamera` in Hierarchy and click `Add Component` in the Inspector.

   :::note
   You can add the TestFairy script to any game object. TestFairy is a singleton so no harm is done.
   :::

   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/step2.png')} alt="step 2"/>

5. Click **Add Component** again, and select a **Script** component. Type in the script's name, for example, `mainCameraScript`, and click on **Create and Add**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/step3.png')} alt="step 3"/>

6. Edit the newly created CSharp script, add `using TestFairyUnity;` to the import section, and a call to `TestFairy.begin();` with your app token. You can find your app token on the [Account Settings](https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken) page.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/testfairy/platform/step4.png')} alt="step 4"/>

   Below is the code for copy-pasting:

   ```java
   using UnityEngine;
   using System.Collections;
   using TestFairyUnity;

   public class mainCameraScript : MonoBehaviour {

   // Use this for initialization
   void Start () {
      TestFairy.begin("PUT YOUR SDK APP TOKEN HERE SEE COMMENT ABOVE");
   }

   ...
   }
   ```

7. Save, build, and run.


## Setting Screen Name

TestFairy can capture screenshots during a recorded session. By default, it attempts to name a screenshot based on different measures automatically. However, you can override this behavior and set a custom name for a captured screen using the `setScreenName` method. This can help you organize and label screenshots with appropriate information, such as the level name. See the example below:


```js
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using TestFairyUnity;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class cameraScript : MonoBehaviour {
...
 void OnLevelWasLoaded(int level) {
 TestFairy.setScreenName(Application.loadedLevelName);
 }
...
}
```

## Log Your Exceptions

To capture exception logs and send them to the TestFairy dashboard, you can use the following code example. This will help you track and analyze any exceptions that occur during the usage of your app.

```js
private void OnEnable()
{
 Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded += HandleLog;
}

private void OnDisable()
{
 Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded -= HandleLog;
}

private void HandleLog(string message, string stackTrace, LogType type)
{
 TestFairy.log(message);
 TestFairy.log(stackTrace);
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter certain errors during the integration process, refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

```bash
ERROR ITMS-90087: "Unsupported Architectures. The executable TestFairy.framework contains unsupported architectures '[x86_64, i386]'
```

This error happens when you export your iOS app to the App Store. The App Store only supports apps built for the ARM architecture; however, to allow developers to test in the iOS Simulator, we include the architectures for 64-bit (x86_64) and 32-bit (i386) Intel architectures.

```bash
Error: exportArchive: IPA processing failed
Error Domain=IDEFoundationErrorDomain Code=1 "IPA processing failed" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=IPA processing failed}
```

This error happens when you export an Ad hoc version of your iOS app. Most often seen in Unity Cloud build.
