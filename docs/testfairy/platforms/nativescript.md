TestFairy for Nativescript is a bridge to the TestFairy SDK. Integrating the TestFairy SDK into your app enables you to better understand how your app performs on real devices. It provides insights into user behavior, session recording, and metrics to optimize your user experience and code.

## Installation

To install the Nativescript TestFairy plugin, run the following command:

```js
tns plugin add nativescript-testfairy
```

## Enabling Session Recording

Once the native library is added to your project, you can now enable session recording with TestFairy:

1. Obtain an app token from your TestFairy account. You can find the app token on the [Preferences](http://app.testfairy.com/settings/) page on your TestFairy account.
2. Import the TestFairy bridge  from your JavaScript file (app.js or app.ts) into you project.
3. Invoke the `begin`  passing in the app token. The best time to invoke `begin` is usually during the `launchEvent` of your application.


Here's an example of how to start your recording in TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as application from 'tns-core-modules/application';
import { TestFairySDK } from 'nativescript-testfairy';

application.on(application.launchEvent, (args) => {
    TestFairySDK.begin(<insert ios app token here>);
});

application.start({ moduleName: "main-page" });
```

Here's the same example of starting your recording in JavaScript:

```js
require("./bundle-config");
var application = require("application");
var TestFairySDK = require('nativescript-testfairy').TestFairySDK;

application.on(application.launchEvent, (args) => {
    TestFairySDK.begin(<insert ios app token here>);
});

application.start({ moduleName: "main-page" });
```

Here's a final sample of starting your recording using Angular:

```js
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { TestFairySDK } from 'nativescript-testfairy';

@Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: "ns-app",
    templateUrl: "app.component.html"
})
export class AppComponent {
	constructor() {
		TestFairySDK.begin(<insert ios app token here>);
	}
}
```

You can now log in to your [account](http://app.testfairy.com) and view your sessions. For more information regarding available APIs, see the [documentation](https://github.com/testfairy/react-native-testfairy/blob/master/index.js).

## User ID and Session Attributes

To learn how to identify users and set session attributes using the TestFairy SDK in Nativescript, refer to the [identifying users section](/testfairy/sdk/identifying-users/) in the SDK Documentation.

## Remote Logging

To understand how to perform remote logging with the TestFairy SDK in Nativescript, refer to the [remote logging section](/testfairy/sdk/remote-logging/) in the SDK Documentation.


## Hiding Views

If you want to hide certain views from session recordings, check the [Nativescript section](/testfairy/sdk/identifying-users/) in the SDK Documentation for instructions.
