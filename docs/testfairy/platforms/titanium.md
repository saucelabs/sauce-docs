The TiTestFairy Module extends the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework with the TestFairy Android and iOS SDKs.

1. Add the module to your Titanium Mobiles

   - “Help” -> "Install Mobile Module..."
   - or by unzipping the contents of the module zip file into your `Titanium/modules/iphone` or `Titanium/modules/android` folders.
