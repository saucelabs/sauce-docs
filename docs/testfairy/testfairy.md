## Distribute App to Testers

TestFairy offers enterprise-grade app distribution capabilities, allowing companies to easily and securely distribute the right apps to users like internal or external beta testers. The platform allows admins to enforce corporate security policies during testing, and has the capability to automatically update apps to new versions or revoke access to installed apps or users.

## Manage everything through API and Integrations

TestFairy provides comprehensive API and integration capabilities, allowing companies to automate app management, user management, beta testers and seamlessly integrate with existing workflows. Use our APIs to manage app/user distribution or enforce security policies programmatically.
