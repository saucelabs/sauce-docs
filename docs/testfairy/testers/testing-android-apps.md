As a tester, you will receive an email invitation from the application developer, inviting you to test a specific application build. Follow the steps below to successfully test the Android app and troubleshoot any installation issues that may arise.

1. Inside the invitation email, click on the provided **Download App** link.

2. Save the application to your device.

3. After downloading, locate the saved application and open it.

4. Upon opening the application, you will be prompted to install it on your device. Click on the **Install** button to proceed with the installation.

5. Once the installation is complete, the application icon should appear on your device's desktop.

## Creating a tester's account
Once you've been invited to test an application via App Distribution, you can create a App Distribution account to manage your testing activities. Open the invitation you've received for testing a new build, and click the **tester account **link.

Click on "I am a tester, I do not know my password" and submit your email address. You will receive an email with instructions for setting a new password for your
tester account.

## Troubleshooting installation

If the application does not install on your device, check for Duplicate Application:

1. If the application fails to install, verify if you already have the same application installed with the same name.
2. If a duplicate application is found, remove it from your device before attempting to install the new version.

If you receive an "Installation blocked" message during the installation process, follow these steps:

1. Go to your device's "Settings."
2. Select "Security" from the options.
3. Look for "Unknown sources" and enable "Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store."
4. Attempt to re-install the application.
