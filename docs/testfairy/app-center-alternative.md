Welcome to App Distribution (TestFairy), the App Center distribution alternative! Use our enterprise-grade app distribution capabilities to migrate from App Center before March 31, 2025!

## Distribute App to Testers

TestFairy offers enterprise-grade app distribution capabilities, allowing companies to easily and securely distribute the right apps to the right users. The platform allows admins to enforce corporate security policies during testing, and has the capability to automatically update apps to new versions or revoke access to installed apps or users.

For more information, see [Managing Testers](/testfairy/testers/managing-testers/).

## Analyze User Behavior

TestFairy provides mobile teams with videos showing exactly what happened during a mobile device test, before a crash, or before something went wrong, which ensures that bugs are fixed quickly.

For more information, see [Adding the TestFairy SDK](/testfairy/sdk/adding-tf-sdk/).

## Collect Feedback

TestFairy's feedback features help users provide feedback by shaking their device or taking a screenshot. A report can automatically be posted to Jira along with the session video recording, logs, metrics, and crash reports.

For more information, see [Getting Feedback](/testfairy/sdk/user-feedback/).

## Security

TestFairy is available as a private cloud or an on-premise installation and can integrate with any SAML single sign-on service. TestFairy is the only platform that provides end-to-end data encryption using your private/public keys, so your data remains private.
App Distribution Public Cloud is available in the EU-Central-1 and US-East-1 data centers. The Private Cloud is available in various regions, customizable based on specific preferences.
