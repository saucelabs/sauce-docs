You should receive an email from the application developer, inviting you to test an application build.

1. Click the “Download App” link in the email.

2. Save the application.

3. Open the application.

4. You will now be prompted to install the application. Click “Install”.

5. The application icon should now appear on your device desktop.

## Creating a tester's account

Once you've been invited to test an application via TestFairy, you can create a TestFairy account to see your invitations, open bugs, download applications, and more. Open the invitation you've received for testing a new build, and click the "tester account" link.

Click on "I am a tester, I do not know my password" and submit your email address. You will receive an email with instructions for setting a new password for your
tester account.

## Troubleshooting installation

If the application does not install on your device, please check if you already have the same application installed with the same name, and remove it.

If you are getting an "Installation blocked" message:

1. Go to "Settings" on your device
2. Choose "Security"
3. Look for "Unknown sources"
4. Activate "Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store"
5. Re-install the application
