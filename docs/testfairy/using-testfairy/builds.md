## Tags

Tags are labels attached to builds for identification that provide additional searchable information. Tag text may contain spaces and more than one word.

You can add tags to a build during upload using the Upload API or edit them in the **Build Settings** menu. They are searchable in the `Search` box at the top of the **Builds** page.

## Metadata

Metadata is specific information about a build. It is defined when the build is uploaded via Upload API and cannot be changed after it is uploaded.

The metadata format is **metadata.key=value** (for example, `metadata.branch=master`). Only the value is searchable in the `Search` box at the top of the **Builds** table.

To delete a build from the system, select the checkbox and, in the **More Actionsâ€¦** dropdown list, click **Delete Build**.
