## Fast and reliable test orchestration for mobile and web apps, at scale.

Sauce Orchestrate is a new and unique approach to web and mobile application testing that increases test execution speed and enables end-to-end test orchestration. The beneifts include:

<b>Test up to 70% faster, from anywhere</b>

Sauce Orchestrate decreases network overhead and reduces the latency between the test and the device or browser.

<b>Reduce costs and optimize CI/CD pipelines</b>

Orchestrate multiple CI builds and reduce the maintenance burden on your resource-constrained CI by offloading the compute cycles to Sauce Labs for test execution.

<b>Accelerate development velocity</b>

Improve development velocity and significantly reduce feedback time by running the same test suite locally early in the development cycle, and at scale in your CI.

<b>Improve reliability</b>

Reduce unpredictable network issues and help developers focus their time on innovation by eliminating the need to troubleshoot errors caused by the heavy network overhead of a remote grid.
