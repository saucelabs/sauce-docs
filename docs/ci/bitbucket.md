- The `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` specific to your Sauce Labs account [Find these](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/managing-user-info)
- Bitbucket account [Sign Up](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/)
- Bitbucket Pipelines installed on your Bitbucket account [Create pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines-792496469.html)

## Procedure

1. Configure your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file to run your tests using your test runner of choice.
1. From your Bitbucket dashboard, choose `Settings`.
1. Under `Pipelines`, choose `Environment Variables`.
