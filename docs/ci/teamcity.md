1. Click **Add build feature** and select **Sauce Labs Build Feature**.
1. Enter your `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`.
1. Select **Enable Sauce Connect** if you want to launch an instance of Sauce Connect prior to running your job that will close upon completion of the job (for use in private network environments in order to establish a secure connection to the Sauce platform).
1. Select the operating system and browser combination you want to test against.  
1. Click **Save**.

### Integrate the Tests

1. From the TeamCity dashboard, click **Run**.
1. When the build completes, click **Results** and choose the **Sauce Labs Results** tab.
1. Click the **Job ID** link to view the test report, which lists the steps performed the test and includes a video of the test.


## Setting Environment Variables

Using environment variables in your configuration file allows you to maintain the values of properties in a single source and then reference them throughout all your jobs, ensuring that, if a modification needs to be made, it only needs to be made in one place in order to take effect in all references.

:::note
If you're using Protractor to run your tests with TeamCity, ensure `disableEnvironmentOverrides` is set to false in your `config.ts` file (this is the default setting) to prevent environment variables from being overridden by that file.

## Outputting the Bamboo Session ID to `stdout`

As part of the post-build activities, the Sauce plugin parses the test result files to detect lines in the `stdout` or `stderr` containing the format:

`SauceOnDemandSessionID=<session id> job-name=<job name>`

To ensure that your test results and Sauce jobs are associated properly, output the `SauceOnDemandSessionID` (obtained from the RemoteWebDriver instance) to `stdout` using the following code.

```
private void printSessionId() {

    String message = String.format("SauceOnDemandSessionID=%1$s job-name=%2$s",
    (((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getSessionId()).toString(), "job name");
    System.out.println(message);
}
```
