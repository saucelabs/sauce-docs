When the TestFairy SDK https://docs.testfairy.com/SDK/Adding_The_SDK_To_Your_App.html is defined in your app, shaking the device will prompt the user to create a feedback issue from within the app.
The issue will appear with an automatically generated screenshot of the app, which can be annotated, and a feedback form where details like email and description can be added.

It is also possible to automatically integrate [Bug Tracking](/test-fairy/testing-an-app/using-bug-tracking) systems to your issues so that when they are created, the issues are passed automatically.
