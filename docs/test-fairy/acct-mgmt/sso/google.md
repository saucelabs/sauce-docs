## Troubleshooting

### `Error: app_not_configured_for_user`

If you are seeing this error message on Google, then it means that you:

- Didn't enable this app for the current user or all users. See the installation section above for how to enable the newly created app for all users.
- Accidentally provided wrong **ACS URL** or **Entity ID**. See the installation section above for the correct values. Notice that every character matters as values must be identical for verification.
