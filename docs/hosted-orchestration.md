:::info
Hosted Orchestration is currently in Limited Beta. If you would like to participate please visit our [Product Portal](https://sauceprod.productboard.com/portal/2-sauce-labs-portal/tabs/b70facc7-2bb5-48d7-9817-6088601116d5/features/16168459/portal/expanded)
:::

Hosted Orchestration runs mobile and browser tests up to 70% faster, from within the Sauce Labs grid via our container execution environment. All you need to do is package your test code as a Docker image and grant us access.

Hosted Orchestration is different from traditional remote grid execution because it removes a large portion of  network traffic, which drastically increases the amount of time to execute a test suite from your environment.
