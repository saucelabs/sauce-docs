This document provides information about KGP - the tunneling protocol used by Sauce Connect Proxy&trade;
to assist customer network and security engineering teams to better understand Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; networking model.

:::note In-depth understanding of the tunneling protocol used by Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; is not required to use it.

## What You'll Need

- Have a working understanding of [Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; architecture](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture)

## KGP - Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; Tunneling Protocol

Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; establishes an encrypted connection between
[Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; client](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client) and
[Sauce Connect Proxy&trade; server](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-server).
This TCP connection is used a reverse tunnel between a customer environment and Sauce Labs data center.
The protocol that is used to achieve the reverse tunneling is called KGP.

KGP is an application layer protocol that carries all HTTP(s) traffic as its payload.
It is developed and maintained by Sauce Labs, and is used to multiplex established connections for multiple HTTP requests/responses.

KGP is preferred over conventional protocols (such as reverse SSH tunnel) for a number of reasons:

- Itâ€™s lightweight
- It reconnects when a connection accidentally disconnects
- It ensures that all the data is sent and received, even over an unstable or intermittent connection
- It provides information about the connection state

## KGP Packet types

KGP defines the following packet types

- Data packets carrying HTTP(s) traffic
- Control packets, which include:
- Connection requests
- Keepalive timers

## KGP Security

KGP, by itself, is not responsible for the connection security, it just allows to multiplex an existing TCP connection.
However, all KGP packets are encrypted with the industry standard TLS 1.2 protocol using OpenSSL library.
