This document provides information about KGP, the tunneling protocol used by Sauce Connect Proxy to assist customer network and security engineering teams to better understand the Sauce Connect Proxy networking model.

:::note

In-depth understanding of the tunneling protocol used by Sauce Connect Proxy is not required to use Sauce Connect.

## What You'll Need

- Have a working understanding of [Sauce Connect Proxy architecture](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture).

## About KGP Tunneling Protocol

Sauce Connect Proxy establishes an encrypted TCP connection between the [Sauce Connect Proxy client](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-client) and [Sauce Connect Proxy server](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/architecture/#sauce-connect-proxy-server). This connection is used as a reverse tunnel between the user environment and Sauce Labs data center.

The protocol used to achieve the reverse tunneling is called _KGP_. It's an application layer protocol that carries all HTTP(s) traffic as its payload. Developed and maintained by Sauce Labs, KGP is used to multiplex established connections for multiple HTTP requests/responses.

KGP is preferred over conventional protocols (such as reverse SSH tunnel) for a number of reasons:

- Itâ€™s lightweight
- It reconnects when a connection accidentally disconnects
- It ensures that all the data is sent and received, even over an unstable or intermittent connection
- It provides information about the connection state

## KGP Message Types

KGP messages (or packets) consist of a header and payload.
KGP header contains infomation about the message type and payload is the original TCP payload that is received via the non-KGP port by the KGP client or server.

KGP defines the following message types:

- Data packets carrying HTTP(s) traffic
- Control packets, which include:
  - Connection requests
  - Keepalive timers

## KGP Security

All KGP packets are encrypted with the industry standard TLS 1.2 protocol using OpenSSL library.
