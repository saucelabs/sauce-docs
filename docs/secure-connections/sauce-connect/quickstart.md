Get up and running with a Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel in just a few minutes by following the instructions below.

## Starting a Tunnel

1. Download the Sauce Connect Proxy client [here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation).
2. For Windows and Mac, extract the .zip download contents to your local machine, open your local terminal, and navigate to the folder where you downloaded Sauce Connect (i.e., `cd sc-4.7.1-osx` or `cd sc-4.7.1-win32`). For Linux, copy [this snippet](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/#linux), then paste and run it in your local terminal.
3. Log in to Sauce Labs.
4. Go to the [**TUNNELS**](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels) page, scroll to **STEP 3: Configure & Authenticate**, and copy the code snippet listed there.
5. Paste the snippet into your local terminal and then run it. This authenticates you, connects you to a Sauce Labs Data Center, assigns an ID for your tunnel, and starts your tunnel.

That's it! Now that your tunnel is up, try running a test. To view additional configuration options, see the [Sauce Connect Proxy CLI Reference](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy/).
