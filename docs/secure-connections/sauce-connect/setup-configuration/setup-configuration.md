Sauce Connect Proxy must be installed on the same network as the application or website you're testing; however, it is not required to install Sauce Connect Proxy on the same local machine. For this reason, when setting up Sauce Connect Proxy, be mindful of how it will interact with your network architecture.

As you’re configuring the setup type that’s right for you, it's important to understand how the program will interact with your network architecture components, such as proxies, firewalls, and geographically distributed data centers.
