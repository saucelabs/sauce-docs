## Sauce Connect Docker Container Setup

As an alternative to downloading and installing the SC Client in your CI/CD environment, you can [leverage Docker containers to manage Sauce Connect Proxy tunnels](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/#running-sauce-connect-in-docker). Our Docker image maintained by the Sauce Labs [Open Source Program Office](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/).

Here are some benefits/use cases:
* If you want to run Sauce Connect Proxy as part of a Dockerized CI/CD.
* If you'd prefer to manage Docker image tags instead of Sauce Connect Proxy versions.
* If your setup involves several instances running on the same system, Docker would simplify Sauce Connect Proxy port management.

### Running the SC Docker Image

1. Before running the container, you'll need to pull the Sauce Connect Proxy Docker Image from the Docker Hub. This will always pull the latest version of Sauce Connect Proxy.
  ```bash
  $ docker pull saucelabs/sauce-connect
  ```
   * Or - if you _do_ want to use specific SC version - you can specify that as a tag:
   ```bash
   $ docker pull saucelabs/sauce-connect:4.7.1
   ```
2. To run the Sauce Connect Proxy Docker image, execute the below script, which will also set your Sauce Labs username and access key as [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables/).
  ```bash
  $ export SAUCE_USERNAME="my-user"
  $ export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="my-access-key"
  docker run \
      -e SAUCE_USERNAME=${SAUCE_USERNAME} \
      -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=${SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY} \
      -it saucelabs/sauce-connect
  ```

If desired, you can specify any additional [SC CLI arguments](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy/) here.

:::note
If you're running tests in Linux that use localhost addresses, you'll need to specify `--network="host"` as an argument in the above script to allow requests originating within the container to access the Docker host machine.
:::

:::info
`--network="host"` behaves differently on Windows, macOS, and Linux due to the respective platform Docker implementation.
:::

### Running the Sauce Connect Proxy Docker Image with a CI/CD Pipeline
If you want to run this Docker image as part of your CI/CD pipeline, you would need a way to determine that Sauce Connect Proxy is ready to proxy the requests. You can achieve that by:
- Using the `/readiness` endpoint, which is available effective with Sauce Connect Proxy v4.8.0
- Using Docker's [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) feature along with our Sauce Connect Proxy [`--readyfile`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy/#--readyfile) flag.

#### Readiness Endpoint
The readiness endpoint, supported in Sauce Connect Proxy versions 4.8.0 and higher, allows you to configure liveness and readiness HTTP probes. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) for more information.

Docker container exposes Sauce Connect Proxy HTTP status server on port 8032. The following endpoints are available:
* `/readiness` returns 200 response code when Sauce Connect Proxy is ready, 503 otherwise
* `/liveness` returns 200 response code when Sauce Connect Proxy is running

You can leverage the readiness endpoint in your CI/CD pipeline by running the following:

1. Create a simple bash script `wait-for-sc.sh` that will ensure the pipeline only continues after Sauce Connect Proxy is fully connected and ready.
   ```bash title="wait-for-sc.sh"
   until [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w ''%{http_code}'' localhost:8032/readiness)" == "200" ]
   do
       sleep 2
   done
   echo "SC ready"
   ```
1. Run Sauce Connect Docker container using the script below. It is important that you map port 8032 so that the port is available to the host.
  ```bash
  $ docker run \
      --detach \
      -e SAUCE_USERNAME=${SAUCE_USERNAME} \
      -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=${SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY} \
      -p 8032:8032 \
      -t saucelabs/sauce-connect:latest \
      -i some-identifier
    $ ./wait-for-sc.sh
    ```

#### Ready File
You can leverage the Sauce Connect Proxy [`--readyfile`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy/#--readyfile) flag to specify a file that will be created (or updated) when the proxy is ready.

1. Create a simple bash script `wait-for-sc.sh` that will ensure the pipeline only continues after Sauce Connect Proxy is fully connected and ready.
   ```bash title="wait-for-sc.sh"
   until [ -f /tmp/sc.ready ]
   do
       sleep 1
   done
   echo "SC ready"
   ```
1. Run Sauce Connect Docker container using the script below. It is important that you mount a temp folder here so that `wait-for-sc.sh` can detect when Sauce Connect has launched.
  ```bash
  $ docker run \
      --detach \
      -e SAUCE_USERNAME=${SAUCE_USERNAME} \
      -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=${SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY} \
      -v /tmp:/tmp \
      --network="host" \
      -t saucelabs/sauce-connect:latest \
      -f /tmp/sc.ready \
      -i some-identifier
    $ ./wait-for-sc.sh
  ```
:::note
`--network="host"` allows Sauce Connect Proxy to access your app in the host machine. It's only required if your app runs on the same machine as the docker host.
:::

Starting with Sauce Connect Proxy 4.8.0, the "ready" file will contain JSON-formatted information about the running Sauce Connect Proxy. For example:

```bash
$ cat /tmp/sc.ready | jq .
{
  "firstConnectedTime": "2022-03-01 11:08:13",
  "scProxyPort": "35181",
  "tunnelID": "182de89899",
  "tunnelName": "my-tunnel",
  "tunnelServer": "maki76.eu-central-1.miso.saucelabs.com"
}
```

## Bamboo Configuration

[Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) is a continuous integration server that can be used to automate the release management for your software apps, creating a continuous delivery pipeline.

We offer a plug-in that will integrate your Bamboo builds with Sauce Connect Proxy for automating functional tests. Installation is an easy one-time admin configuration. From there, you can designate builds to test on your preferred browser/OS combinations.

Here are some of the features:

* Embed Sauce reports within your Bamboo test results
* Configure your Bamboo build to specify the browser combinations
* Configure user name and password within Administration interface

Note that this plug-in also has a set of environment variables that are specific to Bamboo. Youâ€™ll also need to output the Sauce session ID to the standard output (stdout) to allow the plug-in to associate test results with Sauce jobs.


## GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) allow to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository.

[Sauce Connect Proxy GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sauce-connect-proxy-action) allows to launch Sauce Connect Proxy for GitHub CI workflow.


## Jenkins Configuration

Jenkins is an open-source automation server and continuous integration software tool for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time.

The Jenkins plugin for Sauce Labs will automatically install Sauce Connect Proxy on your Jenkins server for integration. Once installed, you'll need to configure your project to use Sauce Connect Proxy. You can change the location where the plugin extracts Sauce Connect for specific projects or globally for all projects.
