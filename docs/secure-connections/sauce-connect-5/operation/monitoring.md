Sauce Connect Proxy provides server-side monitoring via the REST API and the Sauce Labs [web application](https://app.saucelabs.com/) as well as the client-side monitoring via the local API server and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics.

## Sauce Labs Web UI

You can manage and monitor all Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel activity from the Sauce Labs [**Tunnels**](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels) page, which displays useful information, such as the number of active tunnels, tunnel status, and specific attributes for each tunnel. You can also check the health of an individual tunnel by running a test on it.

## Local API Server

See [Sauce Connect Proxy API Server](/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/operation/api-server).

## Prometheus metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics could be used to monitor Sauce Connect Proxy traffic. Grafana dashboard using these metrics is available at [Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20232-sauce-connect/).

See [this demo](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-connect-docker/tree/main/examples/docker-compose-prometheus-grafana) for an example of running Sauce Connect Proxy along with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server and [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) dashboard.
