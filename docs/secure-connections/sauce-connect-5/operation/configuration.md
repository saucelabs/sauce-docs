The explicit way to launch a Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel is to run a single command line comprised of all [flags](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/) and any optional [flags](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/) you want to use to customize tunnel behavior.
It's also possible to pass the same command-line arguments through a config file, and as environment variables.
If you pass the same argument through multiple methods, the order of precedence is as follows (from highest to lowest):

- command-line option
- environment variable
- YAML config file

## Config File

The Sauce Connect Proxy config file may contain any CLI flag. It may also
contain comments that could help make its content more readable, for example:

```yaml
---
region: 'us-west'
username: 'janedoe-sauce'
access-key: 'xxxx-xxx-xxx'
# this is my log file for SC I use for Mac OS tests.
log-file: '/tmp/sc-mac.log'
# this is the tunnel I use for Mac OS tests
tunnel-name: 'my-macos'
```

### Config File Reference

`sc run config-file` command's output below contains all the available options
and their usage.

#### Reference

```bash
# --- Required ---

# access-key <UUID>
#
# Sauce Labs Access Key, you can get it from the User Settings page. For
# additional security, we recommend setting this as an environment variable.
#access-key:

# region <data center>
#
# Sauce Labs region name, ex. us-west or eu-central.
#region:

# tunnel-name <name>
#
# Name of the tunnel or tunnel pool. You can run tests using this tunnel by
# specifying the tunnelName value in your test capabilities.
#tunnel-name:

# username <username>
#
# Sauce Labs username. For additional security, we recommend setting this as an
# environment variable.
#username:

# --- Options ---

# metadata <key=value>,...
#
# Custom metadata key-value pairs.
#metadata:

# shared <all>
#
# Share the tunnel within the same org unit. Only the 'all' option is currently
# supported.
#shared:

# tunnel-pool <value>
#
# Denotes a tunnel as part of a high availability tunnel pool.
#tunnel-pool: false

# --- Tunnel traffic ---

# deny-domains [-]<regexp>,...
#
# Deny requests to the matching domains.
#deny-domains:

# direct-domains [-]<regexp>,...
#
# Forward matching requests to their origin server over the public internet.
# Requests that don't match "direct domains" will be forwarded to customer-side
# over the Sauce Connect Proxy connection. You can specify --direct-domains or
# --tunnel-domains, but not both.
#direct-domains:

# tls-passthrough-domains [-]<regexp>,...
#
# Pass matching requests to their origin server without SSL/TLS re-encryption.
# You can specify --tls-passthrough-domains or --tls-resign-domains, but not
# both.
#tls-passthrough-domains:

# tls-resign-domains [-]<regexp>,...
#
# Resign SSL/TLS certificates for matching requests. You can specify
# --tls-resign-domains or --tls-passthrough-domains, but not both.
#tls-resign-domains:

# tunnel-domains [-]<regexp>,...
#
# Forward matching requests over the Sauce Connect Proxy connection. Requests
# not matching "tunnel domains" will be forwarded to their origin server over
# the public internet. This is the recommended option for the best performance
# since it minimizes the expensive tunnelled traffic and uses it only for
# internal domains that are not publicly available. You can specify
# --tunnel-domains or --direct-domains, but not both.
#tunnel-domains:

# --- Proxy ---

# auth <username[:password]@host:port,...>
#
# Site or upstream proxy basic authentication credentials. The host and port can
# be set to "*" to match all hosts and ports respectively. The flag can be
# specified multiple times to add multiple credentials.
#auth:

# header <header>
#
# Add or remove HTTP request headers. Use the format "name: value" to add a
# header, "name;" to set the header to empty value, "-name" to remove the
# header, "-name*" to remove headers by prefix. The header name will be
# normalized to canonical form. The header value should not contain any newlines
# or carriage returns. The flag can be specified multiple times. Example: -H
# "Host: example.com" -H "-User-Agent" -H "-X-*".
#header:

# pac <path or URL>
#
# Proxy Auto-Configuration file to use for upstream proxy selection. It can be a
# local file or a URL, you can also use '-' to read from stdin. The data URI
# scheme is supported, the format is data:base64,<encoded data>.
#pac:

# proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
#
# Upstream proxy to use for requests received from the Sauce Connect Server
# only. The supported protocols are: http, https, socks, socks5. No protocol
# specified will be interpreted as an HTTP proxy. If the port number is not
# specified, it is assumed to be 1080. The basic authentication username and
# password can be specified in the host string, e.g. user:pass@host:port.
# Alternatively, you can specify the credentials using the -a, --auth flag.
#proxy:

# proxy-localhost <allow|deny|direct>
#
# Setting this to allow enables sending requests to localhost through the
# upstream proxy. Setting this to direct sends requests to localhost directly
# without using the upstream proxy. By default, requests to localhost are
# denied.
#proxy-localhost: deny

# proxy-sauce [protocol://]host[:port]
#
# Proxy for requests to Sauce Labs REST API and Sauce Connect servers only. See
# the -x, --proxy flag for more details on the format.
#proxy-sauce:

# --- DNS ---

# dns-round-robin <value>
#
# If more than one DNS server is specified with the --dns-server flag, passing
# this flag will enable round-robin selection.
#dns-round-robin: false

# dns-server <ip>[:<port>]
#
# DNS server(s) to use instead of system default. There are two execution
# policies, when more then one server is specified. Fallback: the first server
# in a list is used as primary, the rest are used as fallbacks. Round robin: the
# servers are used in a round-robin fashion. The port is optional, if not
# specified the default port is 53.
#dns-server:

# dns-timeout <duration>
#
# Timeout for dialing DNS servers. Only used if DNS servers are specified.
#dns-timeout: 5s

# --- HTTP client ---

# cacert-file <path or base64>
#
# Add your own CA certificates to verify against. The system root certificates
# will be used in addition to any certificates in this list. Can be a path to a
# file or "data:" followed by base64 encoded certificate. Use this flag multiple
# times to specify multiple CA certificate files.
#cacert-file:

# http-dial-timeout <duration>
#
# The maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete. With or
# without a timeout, the operating system may impose its own earlier timeout.
# For instance, TCP timeouts are often around 3 minutes.
#http-dial-timeout: 10s

# http-idle-conn-timeout <duration>
#
# The maximum amount of time an idle (keep-alive) connection will remain idle
# before closing itself. Zero means no limit.
#http-idle-conn-timeout: 1m30s

# http-response-header-timeout <duration>
#
# The amount of time to wait for a server's response headers after fully writing
# the request (including its body, if any).This time does not include the time
# to read the response body. Zero means no limit.
#http-response-header-timeout: 0s

# http-tls-handshake-timeout <duration>
#
# The maximum amount of time waiting to wait for a TLS handshake. Zero means no
# limit.
#http-tls-handshake-timeout: 10s

# --- API server ---

# api-address <host:port>
#
# The server address to listen on. If the host is empty, the server will listen
# on all available interfaces.
#api-address:

# api-basic-auth <username[:password]>
#
# Basic authentication credentials to protect the server.
#api-basic-auth:

# --- Logging ---

# log-file <path>
#
# Path to the log file, if empty, logs to stdout.
#log-file:

# log-http [api|proxy|control:]<none|short-url|url|headers|body|errors>,...
#
# HTTP request and response logging mode. Setting this to none disables logging.
# The short-url mode logs [scheme://]host[/path] instead of the full URL. The
# error mode logs request line and headers if status code is greater than or
# equal to 500.
#log-http:

# log-level <error|info|debug>
#
# Log level.
#log-level: info
```

### Use Cases

We recommend using a configuration file in production environments.

- Facilitates tracking tunnel configuration changes because they're all included in a single file.
- Facilitates management of potentially long CLI options such as tunnel-domains and direct-domains.
- Secures Sauce Connect Proxy credentials with tighter access control.

### Using the Config File

To launch a tunnel using a **config.yml** file option.

1. Create Sauce Connect Proxy config file in any location, for example: `$HOME/sc/config.yml` (`%HOMEPATH%\sc\config.yml` for Windows).
2. Enter values for the properties you'd like to use.
3. Use the `--config-file` flag to run Sauce Connect Proxy with your configuration file.

## Environment Variables

You can set via environment variables all Sauce Connect Proxy [command-line options](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/).
Each option description includes the corresponding environment variable.

### Use Cases

We recommend configuring options via environment variables in the following scenarios.

- Sauce Connect Proxy command containing credentials may be exposed via process monitoring tools such as `ps`.
- When running Sauce Connect Proxy in CI/CD environment to avoid clear-text logging your credentials.
- Sauce Connect Proxy runs in a docker container, and a CI system (such as GitLab) supports secure environment variables.

### Environment Variables For Security

The following flags may contain sensitive information:

- [`--username`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#username)
- [`--access-key`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#access-key)
- [`--auth`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#auth)
- [`--proxy`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#proxy)
- [`--proxy-sauce`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#proxy-sauce)
- [`--header`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#header)
- [`--api-basic-auth`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#api-basic-auth)

We recommend using environment variables for these flags.

| `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`     | Sets your Sauce Labs access key.                                                                              | [`--access-key`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#access-key) |
| `SAUCE_AUTH`           | Sets site or upstream proxy basic authentication credentials.                                                 | [`--auth`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#auth)             |
| `SAUCE_PROXY`          | The basic authentication username and password can be specified in the host string, e.g. user:pass@host:port. | [`--proxy`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#proxy)           |
| `SAUCE_PROXY_SAUCE`    | The basic authentication username and password can be specified in the host string, e.g. user:pass@host:port. | [`--proxy-sauce`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#proxy-sauce) |
| `SAUCE_HEADER`         | May contain headers with sensitive information.                                                               | [`--header`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#header)         |
| `SAUCE_API_BASIC_AUTH` | Contains an optional internal API server authentication.                                                      | [`--api-basic-auth`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/#api-basic-auth) |
