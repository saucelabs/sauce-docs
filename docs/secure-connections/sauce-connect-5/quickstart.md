Sauce Connect Proxy is required to run a test on an app or website located behind a firewall. Get up and running with a basic Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel in minutes using the steps below.

:::caution
The Sauce Connect Proxy version 5 major release introduces CLI changes. Please refer to [Sauce Connect Proxy 5 CLI Reference](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/run/) for details.
An [`sc legacy`](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5/legacy/) command is introduced to help users transition from version 4.x.x to 5.0.x.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
- If you haven't already, make sure you can access the website or mobile app that you'll be testing from the Sauce Connect Proxy host.
- Check to see if you have any [proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/operation/proxies/) that are required to access the public Internet.

## Installing Sauce Connect Proxy

See the [installation instructions](/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/installation/)

## Starting Sauce Connect Proxy

1. Make sure that the directory containing the `sc` binary (`sc.exe` for Windows) is in the `$PATH`. Otherwise, you will have to specify the path to the binary in the command line, `/path/to/sc`
2. Log in to Sauce Labs.
3. Go to the [**Tunnel Proxies**](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels) page.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/sauce-connect/tunnelsPage.png')} alt="Sauce Connect Proxy Tunnels page" width="400"/>
4. Under step 2, **Authenticate & connect**, copy the code snippet.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/sauce-connect/configureAuth.png')} alt="Sauce Connect Proxy Tunnels page snippet" width="300"/>
   <details>
   <summary>What is this?</summary>
   This snippet contains your authentication credentials (username and access key), selects a Sauce Labs Data Center, and applies a name to your tunnel. Optionally, you can rename your tunnel by replacing the value after the <code>--tunnel-name</code> flag.
   </details>
5. Paste the snippet into your terminal and run it. This will launch the tunnel.
6. Follow the steps in the [setup instructions](/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/operation/overview/#running-sauce-connect-proxy) to start Sauce Connect Proxy 5 using the username and the access key obtained in the previous step.

## Verify Connection

To confirm your tunnel is up, look for the confirmation message in your terminal:

```bash
Sauce Connect is up, you may start your tests
```

Alternatively, you can check your list of active tunnels on the **Tunnel Proxies** page:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/sauce-connect/tunnelsuccess-ui.png')} alt="Sauce Connect Tunnel Success" width="500"/>

## Run Test

With your tunnel up and running, try doing a Live <!--or Automated--> local test.

## Stop Tunnel

When you've finished testing, you can stop your tunnel from the terminal where Sauce Connect is running by entering Ctrl+C.
If there are jobs that use Sauce Connect Proxy connection, it will wait for them to finish.

```bash
2024/01/23 15:19:33.152509 [control] [INFO] Sauce Connect is up, you may start your tests
^C
2024/01/23 15:29:12.617959 [control] [INFO] waiting for 1 active job(s) to finish, timeout: 3h0m0s
2024/01/23 15:29:27.622295 [control] [INFO] waiting for 1 active job(s) to finish, timeout: 2h59m45s
2024/01/23 15:29:42.600553 [control] [INFO] waiting for 1 active job(s) to finish, timeout: 2h59m30s
2024/01/23 15:30:00.924115 [control] [INFO] tunnel was shutdown gracefully
