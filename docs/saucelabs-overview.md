Sauce Labs is the only cloud-based testing platform to offer the most up-to-date browser/OS combinations, mobile emulators & simulators, plus real device support.

Our scalable, always-on infrastructure ensures that teams of all sizes can check-in multiple pull requests throughout the day without queuing or bottlenecks, ensuring rapid feedback.

## Cross-Browser, Cross-Device Testing
Securely test websites, web apps, and mobile applications across thousands of desktop & mobile browser and OS combinations in the cloud.

Sauce Labs uses single-use VMs that are destroyed and real devices that are thoroughly cleaned after each test, plus our secure tunneling protocol, [Sauce Connect Proxy](sauce-connect-proxy-overview.md), ensure the highest degree of security.

## Debugging and Analytic Tools

With debugging tools like videos, screenshots and log files, [comprehensive analytics](sauce-insights-overview.md), [live testing environments](live-testing-overview.md), and [Sauce Headless](sauce-headless-overview.md), Sauce Labs maximizes developer productivity.

You can improve the efficiency of your testing with real-time visibility into test data across teams, platforms, and applications.
