## Cross-Browser, Cross-Device Testing
Securely test websites, web apps, and mobile applications across thousands of desktop & mobile browser and OS combinations in the cloud.

Sauce Labs uses single-use VMs that are destroyed and real devices that are thoroughly cleaned after each test, plus our secure tunneling protocol, Sauce Connect Proxy, ensure the highest degree of security.

## Debugging and Analytic Tools

With debugging tools like videos, screenshots and log files, comprehensive analytics, live testing environments, and Sauce Headless, Sauce Labs maximizes developer productivity.

You can improve the efficiency of your testing with real-time visibility into test data across teams, platforms, and applications.
