Virtual USB (vUSB) is a mobile app debugging tool that simulates connecting a Sauce Labs real device directly to your local machine with a USB cable. It integrates into your development environment as if the device is connected directly to your workstation, meaning you can use your choice of homegrown development and testing tools to debug.

* Build and deploy apps directly from any IDE (e.g., Android Studio, Xcode).
* Make the most out of your early stage development.
* Use a mix of live and automated testing as it fits your use case.
* Monitor device performance metrics such as CPU consumption, device memory, and network data performance.
* Interact with your app manually in a live test session using browser-based developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Safari Web Inspector).

>**NOTE**: This topic provides vUSB instructions for Sauce Labs and for TestObject, our [legacy RDC platform](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Legacy+Real+Device+Platform+Resources). To take advantage of our latest features, we recommend using Sauce Labs. For information on upcoming and available real device cloud features, refer to our [feature preview doc](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102721844).

## What You'll Need

<p><Highlight color="#013a70">ENTERPRISE PLANS ONLY</Highlight></p>

* For security reasons, you'll need to have [Sauce Labs Private Devices](https://saucelabs.com/platform/real-device-cloud) enabled as part of your [enterprise pricing plan](https://saucelabs.com/solutions/enterprise) to use Virtual USB. This feature allocates a dedicated pool of Sauce Labs real devices to your organization only.
* Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.
* Administrative rights to install software on your machine.
* Have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
* A mobile native app or web app.
* If you're testing an iOS app:
  * macOS required (not supported for Windows or Linux).
  * Have Xcode installed.
* If you're testing an Android app:
  * Android Debug Bridge (ADB) version higher than 1.0.39.
  * Android Studio 4 or higher.
* If you need to use [Sauce Connect Proxy](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Sauce+Connect+Proxy), you'll need to have the client installed first.

## Virtual USB for Sauce Labs

:::tip CLI Reference
See [Virtual USB CLI Reference](dev/cli/virtual-usb.md) for a full list of vUSB test configuration commands and options. You can also view it in the vUSB client by running `java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar --help`.
:::

### Download Client

1. Click below to download the latest vUSB client to your local machine where you have your IDE installed.

  <p> <a href="https://saucelabs-vusb.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v2.0.0/virtual-usb-client.jar"><button class="download">Download vUSB</button></a> </p>

### Gather Credentials

2. Have your Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` handy. You can find these under **Account** > **User settings**.

3. Have your `--deviceName` handy. This is the **ID** of the device that you want to use for testing. To find this, go to **Live** > **Cross Browser** > **Mobile Real** > Find Your **Private Device** > **Details**.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb-devicename.jpg')} alt="Virtual USB Device Name" width="500" />

  The device you choose will be allocated specifically to you while your session is active. Other users in your organization will see it marked **In Use**.

  As a reminder, vUSB only works on private devices (marked with a <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb-private.jpg')} alt="Sauce Labs Private Device Icon" width="17" />). A quick way to find your organization's private devices from the device list is to click **Filters** and toggle **Private Devices**.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb-privatedevices.jpg')} alt="Virtual USB Private Devices Filters" width="500" />

<br/>

### Start Server

4. On your local machine, launch a command line terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to the folder where you downloaded the vUSB client.

5. In the terminal, enter the [`server`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/start-server) command, followed by `--datacenter US` (Sauce Labs U.S. Data Center) or `--datacenter EU` (Sauce Labs Europe Data Center). This establishes the connection from your local machine to our Real Device Cloud, where your private devices are hosted.
  ```java
  java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar server --datacenter US
  ```

  >**NOTE**: It's important that you run this command in its own unique terminal, separate from terminals used in forthcoming steps, since it acts as a log. It will run continuously throughout your session, logging your activity (i.e., connecting with different real devices). Do not close it. Optionally, you can specify `-v` for verbose logging or `-vv` for super verbose logging.

  **Set Up a Local Server Proxy (Optional)**

  You can launch a proxy tunnel or device proxy tunnel using the [proxy flags compatible with the `server` command](dev/cli/virtual-usb/start-server).

  **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**

  Setting your Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` as [environment variables](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365647#BestPracticesforRunningTests-UseEnvironmentVariablesforAuthenticationCredentials) provides an extra layer of security for your credentials when you reference them from within your tests.


### Start Test Session

6. In this step, you'll establish the connection to your device and start a vUSB test session. There are two ways to do do this:

  **Option 1: Start new session with the vUSB client from the command line**: Open a new command line terminal window and run the [`startSession`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/start-session) command, followed by your `username`, `accessKey`, and `--deviceName`:
<Tabs
  defaultValue="Android"
  values={[
    {label: 'Android', value: 'Android'},
    {label: 'iOS', value: 'iOS'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="Android">

  ```java
  java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar startSession --username john.smith --accessKey ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --deviceName Motorola_Moto_Z_real
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="iOS">

  ```java
  java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar startSession --username john.smith --accessKey ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --deviceName iPhone_XS
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

  To use Sauce Connect Proxy: launch a tunnel in the Sauce Connect client, then add your [`--tunnel-identifier`](https://docs.saucelabs.com/dev/cli/virtual-usb/start-session#--tunnelidentifier), which the vUSB client will use to retrieve and secure test data. You can also set up a device proxy using [proxy command options](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/start-session).

  or

  **Option 2: Connect to existing live testing session**: The second method is to start a live test directly on Sauce Labs, then use the command terminal to [`connect`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/connect-session) the test to your vUSB client.

  First, launch your test on Sauce Labs (**Live** > **Cross Browser** > **Mobile Real** > Find your **Private Device** > **Launch**). Next, locate your `--sessionId` by opening a new command line terminal and running the [`sessions`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/find-sessionid) command, along with your credentials.

  ```java
   java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar sessions --username john.smith --accessKey ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

  This will return a list of your active test sessions.
  ```java
  List of active sessions
  d03a1b81-158d-4bb4-bcc9-074e43dd8465   Samsung Galaxy S10  ANDROID  10
  c7729c7a-56a9-46cf-ba96-958709a86b4f   iPhone XS           IOS      14.3
  e21abb6f-a08e-4685-ba6e-8c6586dd4264   iPhone SE 2020      IOS      14.3
  ```

  Copy the `--sessionId` of your desired test, then run that along with the [`connect`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/connect-session) command and your credentials.

  ```java
  java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar connect --sessionId d03a1b81-158d-4bb4-bcc9-074e43dd8465 ---username john.smith --accessKey ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

7. If your vUSB test session launch is successful, you'll see a success message:
  <Tabs
    defaultValue="Android"
    values={[
      {label: 'Android', value: 'Android'},
      {label: 'iOS', value: 'iOS'},
    ]}>

  <TabItem value="Android">

  The expected output will be your **`--sessionId`**, a **port number**, and a **link**. Click the link to see your device in action, running your tests in real time. You must be logged into Sauce Labs for the link to work.

  ```java
  d03a1b81-158d-4bb4-bcc9-074e43dd8465  Motorola Moto Z    ANDROID   7.0   https://app.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/live/mobile/dataCenters/US/devices/shared/9299h0c88a7-e2b6-41bc-9509-5-8a5d765490371e2c9a

  localhost:7000  online
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="iOS">

  The expected output will be your **`--sessionId`** and a **link** (no port number for iOS).

  ```java
  d03a1b81-158d-4bb4-bcc9-074e43dd8465     iPhone XS         IOS      14.3    https://app.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/live/mobile/dataCenters/US/devices/shared/9299h0c88a7-e2b6-41bc-9509-5-8a5d765490371e2c9a

  localhost:-1  online
  ```

  Make sure you're logged into your Sauce Labs account and click the link above. After doing so, you'll see: 1) an Apple system notification popup, where you'll need to provide Touch ID or password authentication; and 2) information returned in your server logs similar to the example below.

  ```bash
  11:13:12.347 [KQueueEventLoopGroup-2-2] INFO com.saucelabs.vusb.client.server.usbmuxd.SocketMover - The socket at /var/run/usbmuxd needs to be moved
  11:13:12.347 [KQueueEventLoopGroup-2-2] INFO com.saucelabs.vusb.client.server.usbmuxd.SocketMover - This will require administrator privileges!
  ```

  This prepares the usbmuxd socket (`/var/usbmuxd`) so that developer tools like Xcode can interact with the remote device just like they interact with a local device. You will need to have administrator permissions to replace `/var/usbmuxd` on your computer and [disable Systems Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection).

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

8. **Android only**: Link ADB to your test session device by running `adb connect`, followed by the port number:

  ```java
  adb connect localhost:7000
  ```
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb-adb.jpg')} alt="Virtual USB ADB" width="400" />

### Test and Debug

9. Now, you can debug and run tests on your app. For guidance and ideas, see the [Example Use Cases](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/virtual-usb#example-use-cases).

### Close Test

10. When you've finished testing, we recommend closing your vUSB session so that other users can use the device. There are a few ways to do this:

    * If you started your test session with `startSession`, close it out by running the [`deleteSession`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/delete-session) command, followed by your `--sessionId` and credentials.

     ```java
     java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar deleteSession --sessionId 37D274BC3A65A34BB3DA4DDF7B77E341 --username john.smith --accessKey ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```

    * If you started a test session by connecting to a live session on Sauce Labs, close it out by running the [`disconnect`](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/disconnect-session) command, followed by your `--sessionId`.
      * **Android Only**: You'll also need to disconnect your device from ADB. Run `adb disconnect` followed by your `<IPAddress>:<portNumber>`:
       ```java
       adb disconnect localhost:7000
       ```

    * The third option, regardless of your test setup, is to close the browser window where the device session is running.

:::tip
If you've lost track of your `--sessionId`, you can recover it using the [`sessions`](dev/cli/virtual-usb/find-sessionid) command to generate a list of your active device sessions.
```java
java -jar virtual-usb-client.jar disconnect --sessionId 37D274BC3A65A34BB3DA4DDF7B77E341
```

## Virtual USB for TestObject (Legacy)

Below are instructions on how to launch a vUSB real device session in TestObject, our legacy real device platform.

### Known Limitations

#### **Android**

The `adb-reverse` command is not supported.

#### **iOS**
<span className="sauceDBlue">BETA</span>

In TestObject, vUSB for iOS is available in Beta. Contact your Customer Success Manager to request access. Here are the known limitations:

* You'll need to exit Xcode/Safari before connecting to an iOS vUSB session (or relaunch it after connecting). Otherwise, the device won't show up.

* Devices attached to the host locally are not useable while using iOS vUSB. When the server is shut down, it asks again for permissions to put the original `/var/run/usbmuxd` socket back into its place, and Xcode/Safari have to be relaunched to show the local devices.

The below instructions apply to Android only.

### Download Client

1. Click below to download the vUSB client to the same machine where you have your IDE (e.g., Android Studio) installed.

<p> <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/saucelabs-vusb/v1.8/vusb-client.jar"><button class="download">Download vUSB</button></a> </p>

### Gather Credentials

2. Launch TestObject by logging in to your Sauce Labs account, then clicking **Sauce Apps** > **Legacy RDC**.

3. Have your TestObject username and API key handy. To find these, click the person icon > **Account Settings**. Please note that your TestObject credentials are entirely separate from your Sauce Labs username and access key.
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb1.jpg')} alt="TestObject person icon" width="300" />

### Start Server

4. On your local machine, launch a command line terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to the folder where you downloaded the vUSB client.

5. Enter the `server` command, followed by the flag for the Data Center where your private devices are hosted. This establishes the connection from your local machine to our Real Device Cloud.

  <Tabs
    defaultValue="US Data Center"
    values={[
      {label: 'US Data Center', value: 'US Data Center'},
      {label: 'EU Data Center', value: 'EU Data Center'},
    ]}>

  <TabItem value="US Data Center">

  ```java
  java -jar vusb-client.jar server --datacenter US
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="EU Data Center">

  ```java
  java -jar vusb-client.jar server --datacenter EU
  ```

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Start Test Session

6. From a new command line terminal window, separate from the one used in the previous step, launch the client and create a new session using the `startSession` command.

  ```java
  java -jar vusb-client.jar startSession --apiKey 37D274BC3A65A34BB3DA4DDF7B77E341 --deviceName Motorola_Moto_Z_real
  ```

7. If your vUSB test session launch is successful, it will return a success message with a **session ID**, **port number**, and a **link** to watch the device running your test in real time. Make sure you're logged into Sauce Labs before clicking the link.

  ```java
  37D274BC3A65A34BB3DA4DDF7B77E341		Motorola Moto Z		ANDROID		7.0		https://app.testobject.com/#/device/share/9299h0c88a7-e2b6-41bc-9509-5-8a5d765490371e2c9a/view?dc=US

  localhost:7000	online
  ```

8. Copy the **port number** and use it to connect `adb` to your session device using Virtual USB.

  ```java
  adb connect localhost:7000
  ```

### Test and Debug

9. Now, you can debug and run tests on your app. For guidance and ideas, see the [Example Use Cases](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/virtual-usb#example-use-cases).

### Close Test

10. When you've finished testing, we recommend closing your vUSB session so that other users can use the device. There are two ways to do this: close the browser window in which the device is running or disconnect your device from ADB by running `adb disconnect` along with your `<IPAddress>:<portNumber>`:

   ```java
   adb disconnect localhost:7000
   ```

## Example Use Cases

### Exploratory Testing

Introduce breakpoints and then do exploratory testing.

### Android Debugging

You can execute automated adb-based tests using Android Studio, Google Chrome's Remote Debugging, or any other adb-compliant debugging tool. As an example, you can start the camera of the connected device using adb shell:

```java
adb shell
am start -a android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE
```

### iOS Debugging

You can use developer tools within any major browser (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Safari Web Inspector), to debug your iOS apps.

### Generate HAR File for Analysis

This section demonstrates how to connect your test device to Chrome Inspector and export an [Http ARchive (HAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) file to your local machine from a live testing session. Chrome Inspector's suite of developer tools provides a powerful way to work with your web pages while leveraging our real devices.

HAR files are useful for identifying performance issues, network traffic, and other information, such as:

* HTTP requests generated by your web pages
* API calls
* User analytics
* Third-party web service calls

1. Follow the steps in the previous section to start up a test session (i.e., download vUSB client, connect to Data Center, connect to your device, and initialize an `adb` connection). Have your Sauce Labs device test session up on your screen.

2. Open a Chrome tab locally and run `chrome://inspect` in the address bar. This opens the Chrome Inspector.
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb4.png')} alt="Virtual USB" width="400" />

3. Use your command line terminal to open Chrome on the device by running the `adb` commands below. The first one launches the Chrome app:
  ```java
  $ ./adb shell am start -n com.android.chrome/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main
  ```
  Then, navigate to a website (for this example, we'll use our demo site).

  ```java
  $ ./adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d http://www.saucedemo.com
  ```

4. If the above commands are successful, you should see a new set of options under the **Remote Target** heading in your `chrome://inspect` tab.  

  If you click **Inspect**, a new window will open, displaying Chrome DevTools the same as if the device were sitting on your desk, connected to a USB cable.
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb3.png')} alt="Virtual USB" width="400" />
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb2.png')} alt="Virtual USB" width="600" />

5. Click the **Network** tab and reload the page to display all HTTP requests made during the refresh:

6. Under the **Network** tab, click the down arrow icon to export a HAR file locally. This will prompt you with a Save dialog. Choose a location for the HAR file.
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/virtual-usb/vusb6.png')} alt="Virtual USB HAR" width="600" />

7. Review your HAR file. It should contain every HTTP request/response gathered during the page load, as well as all of the headers, parameters, timing info. Using this information, you can dive deep into the way your web pages are put together. You can do it on any configured device, without having to worry about power management or keeping up with the physical device.
