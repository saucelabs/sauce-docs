Explore View Tree is a feature that is designed to help you discover all the visible elements of your mobile application while developing your test scripts. It captures a snapshot of the user interface and allows you to navigate and explore the view objects of your native apps.

Explore View Tree feature allows you to see, debug, analyze or determine the state of individual View components. It also informs you about global changes in the view tree.

:::note
This feature CANNOT be used as Appium Inspector. If you wanna use Appium Inspector please visit the following link: https://github.com/saucelabs/appium-inspector-saucelabs
Such global changes include, for example, a layout of the whole tree.
:::

The feature speeds up your debugging experience of QA SDET for automated test scripts, and expedites the debugging and validating View and UI-related issues. Finally, the Explore feature is a critical factor for easy validation of accessibility labels.
