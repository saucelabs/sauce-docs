The App Crash Logs feature on Sauce Labs' Real Device Cloud (RDC) platform facilitates the automatic capture and display of crash data, both during live and automated testing. This eliminates the necessity to integrate an SDK or connect crash reporting tools to our system.

Through the App Crash Logs feature, users gain access to a centralized view encompassing an array of app diagnostic signals. This expedites the debugging process for teams and reduces issue resolution time. Our primary objective is to establish expedited feedback loops for developers, enabling the early identification of risks and ensuring comprehensive coverage within the development cycle. With this enhanced capability, teams can effectively prioritize errors, crashes, and test failures based on complete data and context, focusing their efforts on the most critical issues.

Our tool has the capability to detect and record fatal errors (crashes) that occur during the testing of iOS and Android apps. This information is sent to Error Reporting, where detailed call stack information can be viewed. Furthermore, our interface also renders all non-fatal errors and warnings originating from the native application visible. This feature streamlines debugging and facilitates seamless integration with other Mobile App Diagnostics components, ultimately enhancing issue identification and resolution efficiency.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
- A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app
- Make sure instrumentation is enabled, no other configuration is required.

## Viewing the App Crash Logs for Real Devicesâ€‹

The App Crash Logs feature is automatically activated when the [Instrumentation feature](/mobile-apps/features/mobile-app-diagnostics/interactions/#using-interactions-for-real-devices) is enabled. Upon detecting a crash, our system will exhibit an `App Crashed` label for the corresponding test result, regardless of the test's status.

When you navigate to the [Live Test Results](/mobile-apps/live-testing/live-mobile-app-testing/) or [Automated Test Results](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/) page, you can view the collected crashes in the Crashes tab or you can see them in the Error Reporting. The collected crashes are presented in the context of their respective test cases, videos, and interactions. This centralized view is designed to enable efficient collaboration within your team and improve time to resolution for any issues that may arise.

### Viewing the App Crash in the Crashes Tab

The `crash.json` log provides detailed information on the stack trace, methods, classes, and lines of code that were being executed before the fatal error occurred. This detailed information facilitates the identification of the root cause of the crash, enabling your team to address the underlying issues in a timely and effective manner.

### Viewing the App Crashes in Error Reporting

In the Interactions tab, the View Crash in Error Reporting link will leads you to the Error Reporting Debug view for that instance. The view will gives you all the useful information like the threads and the call stacks details. The errors are grouped together to avoid debugging the same error more times.

## Downloading the App Crash Log

You can download the crash log as a text file to save and share with Sauce Labs support for further analysis. This feature allows you to keep a record of the crash logs and use them for future reference or troubleshooting:
