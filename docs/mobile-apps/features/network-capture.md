Network Traffic Capture is a feature that allows you to record and analyze HTTP/HTTPS network traffic, during mobile app tests on real Android and iOS/iPadOS devices.
This functionality provides detailed insights into how an app interacts with network services, making it an essential tool for debugging,
performance optimization, and identifying issues in the app's data exchange processes. By capturing network traffic, users can pinpoint
the exact moment and nature of a failure, such as identifying requests that time out, pinpointing requests that slow down the loading process,
or locating faulty API calls. This enables quicker resolution and ensures a more precise assignment of responsibility when passed on to developers.

The captured traffic is presented in the [HTTP Archive (HAR) file format](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)>), which offers a
comprehensive view of the request and response cycles, including headers, payloads, and timings, enabling in-depth troubleshooting and performance analysis.

In combination with our [Network Throttle](/mobile-apps/features/network-throttling/) functionality to simulate various network scenarios,
you have the tools to replicate and troubleshoot any performance concerns stemming from network operations.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
- A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app that makes HTTP/HTTPS requests.

## System-wide Network Capture

Our system-wide network capture feature enhances network monitoring by capturing all HTTP/HTTPS requests made from the device, offering
visibility beyond just a single app or service. It works seamlessly regardless of the app’s framework or if it’s a hybrid application.
This comprehensive approach provides a holistic view of network activity, giving you deeper insights into how various components of the
device interact with external services. To ensure the captured data remains relevant and manageable, our system filters out some OS-specific
services that can otherwise create unnecessary noise.

On iOS/iPadOS devices, this feature works seamlessly without requiring any [resigning](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/ipa-files/#sauce-labs-resigning-enablements)
or changes to the app, making it simple and efficient to use.

For Android devices, a minor modification in the manifest is necessary, but all required changes will be handled by us. This means no
complete resigning or additional instrumentation is needed, ensuring a smooth feature enablement.

## Using system-wide Network Capture

1. In Sauce Labs, from the left navigation, click **App Management**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/app-management.png')} alt="App Management" width="750"/>
2. Upload your mobile app to Sauce Labs [through our UI](/mobile-apps/app-storage/#uploading-apps-via-ui) or [our REST API](/mobile-apps/app-storage/#uploading-apps-via-rest-api).
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/app-logs-8.png')} alt="App Logs" width="750"/>
3. After you’ve uploaded your app, locate it in the table and select **Settings** from the corresponding row.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/app-management-select-settings.png')} alt="Select Settings" width="750"/>
4. Under **Real Device Settings** enable **Network Capture**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/network-capture-app-settings.png')} alt="Network Capture App Setting" width="750"/>

Now you can start your live or automated testing session. Your network logs will be captured and displayed in the test results page as well as during a Live Testing session with the Developer Options window.

:::note All platforms

In order to be able to see network traffic in your test report and ensure a smooth and error free testing experience, please make sure:

- Network protection features in 3rd party networking SDKs and Secure SDKs are disabled.
- All runtime checks for SSL pinning ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9ejcf8y)/[Android](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-ssl)) are disabled.
- Upload a debug build of your application. ([iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project)/[Android](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants))

Otherwise your app will accidentally mark Sauce's capture as untrustworthy and internet access for HTTPS will be limited.

:::

:::note Android Only

For Android applications, a minor modification in the manifest is necessary to make your app trust our proxy certificate. We'll do this for you automatically on the fly, right before we install the app to the target device.

### Automated Testing

The [App Settings](/mobile-apps/live-testing/live-mobile-app-testing/#app-settings) act as default configurations, but can be overridden by the capabilities specified in your test script. 
To control whether network capture is enabled or disabled, add the **networkCapture** capability to your test script.

#### Appium

Enable the following capability when you execute your tests.

- [Sauce-specific Appium capability networkCapture](/dev/test-configuration-options/#networkcapture)

#### Native Tests (Espresso/XCUITest)

Upload your mobile app to Sauce Labs [through our UI](/mobile-apps/app-storage/#uploading-apps-via-ui) or [our REST API](/mobile-apps/app-storage/#uploading-apps-via-rest-api). 

Navigate to **App Management** and locate your app's settings to enable the feature by default for all tests.

<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/networkcapturescr.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="600" />
<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/networkcapturescr2.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="800" />

Alternatively, define it in your **saucectl** configuration the following way:

- [Espresso via saucectl](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/espresso/#networkcapture)
- [XCUITest via saucectl](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/xcuitest/#networkcapture)

### Accessing Network Traffic in real-time (Live Testing)

To be able to observe network traffic in real-time:

1. Navigate to **Live** -> **Mobile App**/**Cross Browser**
2. Choose device and start a session
3. In the live test window, in the left toolbar, open the **Developer Options** and select the **Network tab**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/network-capture-1.png')} alt="Select Developer Options" width="700"/>

4. Start the network capture.
   
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/network-capture-2.png')} alt="Start capture" width="700"/>

5. Inspect network logs in the [Sauce Labs Network Viewer](/mobile-apps/features/network-capture/#sauce-labs-network-viewer) as they arrive.
 
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/network-capture-3.png')} alt="Inspect network logs" width="700"/>

#### Cross Browser 

To enable System-wide network capture for cross-browser tests, click on **Developer Options** during a Live Testing session on the sidebar.

If you need to localize the capture context with just the browser and omit all network calls from the system entirely, then prefer 
 using our [DevTools](/web-apps/live-testing/dev-tools/) solution. It will allow you to isolate network calls from individual browser tabs and provide a richer debugging experience.
