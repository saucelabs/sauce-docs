Audio Capture is a functionality that gives you the ability to record the audio stream generated by your native mobile app (Android or iOS/iPadOS) during a live or automated real device test. 

With this feature, the audio is recorded on our side and merged with the video recording, which you can access in your **Test Results**.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app.


## Using Audio Capture on Real Devices

To enable Audio Capture in your tests: 
 
1. On Sauce Labs, click **Live** > **Mobile App**.
2. [Upload your mobile app to Sauce Labs](/mobile-apps/app-storage) through the UI or CLI.
3. After you’ve uploaded your app, return to the **Live** > **Mobile App** page, hover your mouse over your app, and then select **Settings**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/networkcapturescr.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="600"/>
4. Under **Default Settings**, toggle **Instrumentation and App/OS Audio** to enable the feature. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/audio_capture_screen2.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="800"/>
5. **For Automated Testing only:** add the `audioCapture` capability to your test script. Click the link below that corresponds to your framework:
   * [Espresso](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/espresso/#audiocapture)
   * [XCUITest](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/xcuitest/#audiocapture)
   * [Appium](/dev/test-configuration-options/#audiocapture)
  
Now you can start your live or automated testing session. Your audio recording will be captured and be part of the video recording on the Test Results page.



### Audio Streaming

<p><small><span className="sauceDBlue">BETA</span></small></p> <p><small><span className="sauceDBlue">Real Devices Only</span></small></p> 

You will be able to stream audio during a Live Testing session in our BETA program! Please contact your account team at Sauce Labs for the enrollment information.

The Audio Streaming feature ensures a better digital experience by validating audio playback and testing user flows that require audio testing in the early stages of the development lifecycle. With the Audio Streaming feature, you are able to hear the sound your application is making during a Live Testing session. It allows you to validate audio streams, notification sounds, and animations. 

:::note
You will be able to mute and unmute the sound during your session by clicking on the mute/unmute button on the toolbar:

:::

After you have been enrolled in the BETA program, you just need to launch a Live Testing session on a real device, and the audio will be streamed automatically. 

## Streaming Limitations

:::note Limitations
* Audio Streaming is supported on iOS/iPadOS 13.2 and above.
* Audio Streaming is supported on Android 10 and above.
* When Audio Streaming is enabled, we are not attaching the audio to the test results after the session ends.

## Using Audio Capture on Android

You will be able to capture audio on Android 10 and above.

:::note
Once `audioCapture` is enabled, the status bar will display the recording icon.
:::

We use native Android audio capture for seamless audio capture for our real devices experience. Your test results and sessions are secured, and can only be viewed by you.
:::caution
If your apps's manifest.xml file defines `android:allowAudioPlaybackCapture="false"`, you need to enable instrumentation to have Audio Capture work for your apps.

## Using Audio Capture on iOS/iPadOS

You will be able to capture audio from iOS 10+ up. 

:::note
The status bar clock will display a static 9:41 time during the recording of live testing session. This is a visual limitation for audio capture, and the system clock will not be affected.

## Accessing the Audio in Your Test Tesults

The audio recording will be included in the video recording, which you can play back and download from the built-in media player on the **Test Results** page. 

You can also download the video file with the included audio stream programmatically using the following API request: 

```
curl --compressed \ -O https://{SAUCE_USERNAME}:{SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY}@{DATA_CENTER}.saucelabs.com/v1/rdc/jobs/{JOB_ID}/video.mp4
```
