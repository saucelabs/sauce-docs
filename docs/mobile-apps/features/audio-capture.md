Audio Capture is a functionality that gives you the ability to record the audio stream generated by your native mobile app (Android or iOS/iPadOS) during a live or automated real device test. 

With this feature, the audio is recorded on our side and merged with the video recording, which you can access in your **Test Results**.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app.


## Using Audio Capture on Real Devices

To enable Audio Capture in your tests: 
 
1. On Sauce Labs, click **Live** > **Mobile App**.
2. [Upload your mobile app to Sauce Labs](/mobile-apps/app-storage) through the UI or CLI.
3. After youâ€™ve uploaded your app, return to the **Live** > **Mobile App** page, hover your mouse over your app, and then select **Settings**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/networkcapturescr.png')} alt="Mobile app settings navigation" width="600"/>

5. **For Automated Testing only:** add the `audioCapture` capability to your test script. Click the link below that corresponds to your framework:
   * [Espresso](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/espresso/#audiocapture)
   * [XCUITest](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/xcuitest/#audiocapture)
   * [Appium](/dev/test-configuration-options/#audiocapture)
  
Now you can start your live or automated testing session. Your audio recording will be captured and be part of the video recording on the Test Results page.



### Streaming Audio during a Live Session (coming soon)

## Using Audio Capture on Android

You will be able to capture audio on Android 10 and above.

:::note
Once `audioCapture` is enabled, the status bar will display the recording icon.
:::

We use native Android audio capture for seamless audio capture for our real devices experience. Your test results and sessions are secured, and can only be viewed by you.
:::caution
If your apps's manifest.xml file defines `android:allowAudioPlaybackCapture="false"`, you need to enable instrumentation to have Audio Capture work for your apps.

## Using Audio Capture on iOS/iPadOS

You will be able to capture audio from iOS 10+ up to iOS 15.3. 

:::note
The status bar clock will display a static 9:41 time during the recording of live testing session. This is a visual limitation for audio capture, and the system clock will not be affected.

## Accessing the Audio in Your Test Tesults

The audio recording will be included in the video recording, which you can play back and download from the built-in media player on the **Test Results** page. 

You can also download the video file with the included audio stream programmatically using the following API request: 

```
