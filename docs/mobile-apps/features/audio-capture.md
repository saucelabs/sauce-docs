Audio Capture is a functionality that gives you the ability to record the audio stream generated by your native mobile app (Android or iOS/iPadOS) during a live or automated real device test.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
- A native Android, iOS, or iPadOS mobile app.

## Using Audio Capture for Automated Tests on Real Devices

To enable Audio Capture in your automated tests, you need to use the following capabilities:

Click the link below that corresponds to your framework:

- [Espresso](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/espresso/#audiocapture)
- [XCUITest](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/xcuitest/#audiocapture)
- [Appium](/dev/test-configuration-options/#audiocapture)

Now you can start your automated testing session. Your audio recording will be captured and be part of the video recording on the Test Results page.

### Using Audio Streaming during a Live Testing session on Real Devices

<p><small><span className="sauceDBlue">Real Devices Only</span></small></p>

You just need to launch a Live Testing session on a real device, and the audio will be streamed automatically without any configuration.

The Audio Streaming feature ensures a better digital experience by validating audio playback and testing user flows that require audio testing in the early stages of the development lifecycle.

With the Audio Streaming feature, you are able to hear the sound your application is making during a Live Testing session. It allows you to validate audio streams, notification sounds, and animations.

:::note
You will be able to mute and unmute the sound during your session by clicking on the mute/unmute button on the toolbar:

We use native Android audio capture for seamless audio capture for our real devices experience. Your test results and sessions are secured, and can only be viewed by you.

:::caution
If your apps's manifest.xml file defines `android:allowAudioPlaybackCapture="false"`, you need to enable instrumentation to have Audio Capture work for your apps.
