Sauce Labs provides biometrics interception for our customers to:

- Access test flows that are dependent on biometrics support, such as a mandatory security layer.
- Verify that an app responds as expected to biometrics settings (e.g., enabled/disabled and successful/unsuccessful).

Biometrics test support in Sauce Labs is not intended to test actual biometrics values for authentication.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
- Your mobile app file. If you don't have one on hand, consider using our [React Native Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-rn/releases).

## Key Specs

Biometric Authentication is available for testing on all Sauce Labs Android and iOS real devices.

### Android Biometrics

For Android devices, there are multiple ways to configure biometrics. From API 28 and above we support the following:

- [`BiometricManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager) provides APIs to query if the app can authenticate and a list of [Authenticators](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricManager.Authenticators).
- [`BiometricPrompt`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt) provides a user interface in the form of a dialog for the user's finger touch, and the call [`BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback) provides the response of the fingerprint Authentication.

From API 23 to 28 we support the following:

- [`FingerprintManager.authenticate()`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager#authenticate(android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager.CryptoObject,%20android.os.CancellationSignal,%20int,%20android.hardware.fingerprint.FingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback,%20android.os.Handler)>) triggers the authentication.
- [`FingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/fingerprint/FingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback.html) provides an instant response of the fingerprint.

### iOS Biometrics

For iOS devices, biometrics can be configured with different outputs. We support the following instance methods:

- [`evaluatePolicy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/1514176-evaluatepolicy) evaluates the specified policy. The method [`canEvaluatePolicy`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/1514149-canevaluatepolicy) checks whether the authentication can proceed for a given policy.
- [`biometryType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/2867583-biometrytype) determines the type of biometric authentication method supported by the device, and the method [`evaluatedPolicyDomainState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/1514150-evaluatedpolicydomainstate) assesses the current state of the policy domain.
- [`interactionNotAllowed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext/2873508-interactionnotallowed) indicates if the authentication can be interactive.
- [`SecItemAdd`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1401659-secitemadd) adds one or more items to a keychain. [`SecItemCopyMatching`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1398306-secitemcopymatching) returns more keychain items that match the search query. You can delete items that match the search query by using the [`SecItemDelete`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1395547-secitemdelete) method. We support the following SecItem Classes: [`kSecClassGenericPassword`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecclassgenericpassword) and [`kSecClassInternetPassword`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecclassinternetpassword).

## Live Testing

## Automated Testing

### Real Devices

To enable fingerprint and facial recognition on iOS and Android real devices:

1. Add the `allowTouchIdEnroll` capability to your test configuration and set it to `true`.
   :::note
   Setting `allowTouchIdEnroll` does not update your app's biometric interception setting in Sauce Labs. It only sets the capability for the test in the event that the app setting in Sauce Labs is _different_ from the test script capability.
   - If biometric interception is ENABLED for the app in Sauce Labs, setting `allowTouchIdEnroll=true` or omitting it will have no effect, but setting `allowTouchIdEnroll=false` will disable the enrollment for the test, overriding the app setting.
   - The opposite is true if biometric interception is DISABLED for the app in Sauce Labs.
   :::
   ```js reference title="JavaScript iOS Capabilities Example"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/configs/wdio.ios.sauce.rdc.conf.ts#L33
   ```
2. Use the following commands to trigger a successful or failed authentication in response to a biometric prompt:
   - `driver.execute('sauce:biometrics-authenticate=true');` passes a successful authentication to the prompt.
   - `driver.execute('sauce:biometrics-authenticate=false');` passes a failed authentication to the prompt.
3. Sauce Labs intercepts this command to trigger an authentication response prior to engaging Appium, which is why the result is not captured in the Appium logs. <br /><br />
   The following sample test script shows the selectors for Android and iOS, as well as the command to execute the authentication.
   ```js reference title="JS-Demo Biometrics Test Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.rdc.spec.ts#L25-L41
   ```

### iOS Simulators

Testing biometric interception on Sauce Labs iOS Simulators or on your local machine involves writing your script to ensure biometrics is enabled for both the device and the app, and then simulating either a successful or failed authentication to ensure that the expected behavior results.

1. In your test script, check the device setting for biometrics, as shown in the `prepareBiometrics` function in our demo script:
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Biometrics Check Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L10-L31
   ```
   :::note Setting allowTouchIdEnroll capability is optional
   You can set the desired capability `allowTouchIdEnroll` to `true` to enable enrollment by default for your app, but if you are checking the enrollment in your script anyway, this is not required.
   :::
2. If biometrics is disabled, call the `driver.toggleEnrollTouchId(true)` method to enable it.
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Toggle Biometrics Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L33-L41
   ```
3. Now that biometrics is enabled for the device, make sure it is also enabled for the app.
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Enable Biometrics in App"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L48-L49
   ```
4. Wait for the login screen to appear, then call the `submitBiometrics(true)` method to simulate a successful biometric authentication.
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Submit Bio Auth Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L60-L71
   ```
5. Run your test. Call:
   - Local environment: `npm run test.local.ios.simulator`
   - Sauce Labs US Data Center: `npm run test.sauce.ios.simulator.us`
   - Sauce Labs EU Data Center: `npm run test.sauce.ios.simulator.eu`

### Android Emulators

As with iOS, when testing on Android Emulators, you can first perform a check to see whether the device is enabled for biometric authentication. The test script in this samples is actually the same script for both iOS and Android -- the only difference is in setting the device enrollment.

1. In your test script, check the device setting for biometrics, as shown in the `prepareBiometrics` function in our demo script:
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Biometrics Check Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L10-L31
   ```
2. Android does not have a capability to control the device's biometric enablement. Instead, you must go through the device's enrollment process and call an ADB command to set the PIN values representing the successful and failed authentication. Our demo repo uses a separate script to do this, and then calls the script in the test.
   ```js reference title'"AndroidSettings Biometric Enrollment Script Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/screen-objects/AndroidSettings.ts#L87-L105
   ```
   ```js reference title="Enable Device Biometrics in Test Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L42-L46
   ```
3. Now that biometrics is enabled for the device, make sure it is also enabled for the app.
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Enable Biometrics in App"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L48-L49
   ```
4. Wait for the login screen to appear, then call the `submitBiometrics(true)` method to simulate a successful biometric authentication.
   ```js reference title="WebdriverIO Submit Bio Auth Sample"
   https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-js/blob/docs-1.1/webdriverio/appium-app/examples/biometric-login/test/specs/biometrics.emusim.spec.ts#L60-L71
   ```
5. Run your test. Call:
   - Local environment: `npm run test.local.ios.simulator`
   - Sauce Labs US Data Center: `npm run test.sauce.ios.simulator.us`
   - Sauce Labs EU Data Center: `npm run test.sauce.ios.simulator.eu`
