## Gestures

Building a great user experience is more than just design. Equally important is creating intuitive user interactions and touch gestures.

## Biometric Authentication

If your mobile app requires a biometric authentication (i.e., Touch ID or Face ID) you can chose two authentication options by using the Biometric Authentication Tool in the toolbar during your test session.

## Camera Image Injection

Camera Image Injection – also known as camera mocking – is a Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud (RDC) feature that simulates taking a picture through your mobile device app, allowing you to test the app’s camera-based functionality and deliver the best possible user experience.
