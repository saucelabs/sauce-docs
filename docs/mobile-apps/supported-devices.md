Getting the most out of your live and automated testing means including a healthy mix of Emulators, Simulators, and real devices as your mobile testing platforms. Why? Most aspects of the mobile experience you can test on Emulators or Simulators, while some scenarios require testing on physical real devices (e.g., memory consumption, CPU usage, location-based apps that use manufacturer-specific device sensors).

There are a variety of use cases to consider when you're deciding on the mix of Emulators, Simulators, and real devices to use in your testing.

We support thousands of device/OS combinations and test automation frameworks such as Appium, Espresso, XCUITest, and Robotium. For a full list, see [Supported Browsers & Devices](https://saucelabs.com/platform/supported-browsers-devices).

## When to Test on Emulators and Simulators

### Use Cases

If you need:

- Massive concurrency.
- To reduce build times.
- To save costs.
- Immediate availability.
- Extremely low error rates for your test environment.
- Longer test times -- native framework tests on real devices enforce a maximum test duration limit of 60 minutes.

## When to Test on Real Devices

The Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud (RDC) provides you with the ability to run live and automated tests across Android and iOS devices. [Learn more here](https://saucelabs.com/platform/real-device-cloud).

### Use Cases

If you need:

- A breadth of device types for panel/compatibility testing.
- Manual, interactive testing on actual physical devices.
- To replicate an issue to match exact model as reported.
- Pixel-perfect display testing.
- To test hardware dependencies like CPU, memory, display, GPS.
- To test native ARM Libraries.
- To test on a custom OS (e.g., Samsung TouchWiz, OnePlus OxygenOS)
- To test on a native framework like Espresso and Robotium.
- To test scenarios that require carrier network connectivity (e.g., making phone calls and sending SMS messages to devices with SIM cards).

### Public Device Cloud

Our public cloud, available to all users regardless of pricing plan, contains a wide selection of thoroughly cleaned devices. They are subject to availability. On the mobile device selection screen, if a device is in use, it'll be marked with a [**In Use** flag](/mobile-apps/live-testing/live-mobile-app-testing/#public-vs-private-devices). Here are some use cases:

- The devices available on the public cloud are sufficient for your testing coverage.
- You need to reproduce bugs on a selection of hundreds of iOS and Android devices.
- You need to upload and spot check apps on devices you don’t have access to.
- You need to share manual test sessions and devices across teams worldwide.
- You are looking for a low-cost real device testing option.

### Private Device Cloud

<p><span className="sauceDBlue">Enterprise Only</span></p>

This is dedicated pool of devices just for your organization. On the mobile device selection screen, your private devices are marked with a [green device icon](/mobile-apps/live-testing/live-mobile-app-testing/#public-vs-private-devices). Here are some use cases:

- You need to use a very specific set of devices that aren't supported on the public cloud.
- Your security team insists on dedicated devices.
- You want to run automated parallel tests across multiple devices simultaneously.
- You need specific settings which are set on the devices all the time.
- You need to establish a secure [IPSec VPN connection](/secure-connections/ipsec-vpn) between your network and the Sauce Labs cloud.

### Security

#### Real Device Cleaning

We use a proprietary process that wipes every real device clean at the end of the testing session:

- User accounts and data are cleared from the device.
- History and user data is removed from the default system browser. Non-default browsers are uninstalled.
- Network settings are reset.
- Device settings are reset.
- Your app is uninstalled.
- Cached data is deleted.
- Device is de-allocated from you.

:::caution
While we take these actions to clean public real devices after each test session, we do not perform factory resets nor do we have anti-virus software installed on them. It is possible that other users of the public RDC may engage in malicious, careless or unsecure activity, and that sophisticated, persistent malware could therefore be present on any device in the public RDC.
:::

:::caution
If you test a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and install it on the home screen of the device, make sure that you remove the PWA manually before you close your session. At the moment we can’t remove the PWA and its data during our cleaning process.
:::

#### Data Center Security

Real Device Cloud Data Center security is described in [Data Center Endpoints](/basics/data-center-endpoints).

### Static and Dynamic Device Allocation

Regardless of the test frameworks you're using (Appium, Espresso, XCUITest), you can configure your real device tests using static and dynamic device allocation. While the syntax may be different (i.e., `--device`, `deviceName`), the functionality is the same across all frameworks.

#### Static Device Allocation

This is specifying an exact device for your test by setting `deviceName` to the Device ID, which you can find under **Live** > **Mobile-App** > **Choose device** > Find Your Device > **Details**.
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/samsung-galaxyA10.jpg')} alt="Sauce Labs Device ID example" width="450"/>

When using this, there's no need to specify the `platformName` and `platformVersion` because they'll be set by default (i.e., if you include these separately included in your test script, they will be ignored).

```java
capabilities.setCapability("appium:deviceName", "iPhone_11_13_5_real_us");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
<br/>

#### Dynamic Device Allocation

This is specifying basic parameters for the device name or platform version of the device you want to use in your tests using [regular expressions (regex)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to dynamically allocate a device. A device(s) with your specifications will be selected from the real device pool.

:::note NOTE
The more strict you set the capabilities, the smaller the pool of available devices will be and the longer you might need to wait for an available device.
