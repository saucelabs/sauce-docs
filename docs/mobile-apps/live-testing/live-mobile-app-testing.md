With Sauce Labs, you can test your mobile apps on a variety of Android and iOS/iPadOS devices. If you do not have an app, consider using the [Sauce Labs demo app](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-rn) for validating your account functionality as well as your tests.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
- Your mobile app file. If you don't have one on hand, consider using our Demo Apps:
  - [React Native Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-rn/releases)
  - [iOS Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-ios/releases)
  - [Android Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-android/releases)

### Uploading an App

You can upload your app via the Sauce Labs UI or via the REST API. For information about uploading via the API, see [Upload Files with the REST API](/mobile-apps/app-storage).

To upload an app via the Sauce Labs UI:

1. On Sauce Labs, in the left panel, click **App Management**.
2. To upload an app you can either drag and drop an app or browse for and select the file. We currently support \*.apk Android app files, \*.aab Android App Bundle files, and \*.ipa or \*.zip iOS app files (\*.zip files are parsed to determine whether a valid \*.app bundle exists). Non-app file uploads are not supported in the UI at this time, but can be uploaded through the API.

If you don't have an app to test, you can use the [Sauce Labs sample mobile app](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile).

### Deleting an App

Deleting an app in Sauce Labs will delete the whole app (i.e., the group of builds belonging to the same app package). Files associated with app identifiers (i.e., belonging to the same platform and accessible to the same team) are indicated by the + symbol next to the version number. Also, the version number shown is the most recently updated file, not necessarily the latest version of the app.

To delete an app, on the **App Management** page, hover over the app and then click **Delete**.

| Device Passcode <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">Real Devices Only</span></p>          | Enable/disable the device passcode for your apps. If your app requires a device passcode/screenlock to launch, you can enable this setting to run your tests on a passcode-protected device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Instrumentation                                                                            | Enable/disable device instrumentation. Enabling allows you to use advanced features when testing your app in the real device cloud, like image injection and taking screenshots of secure views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Image injection allows you to mimic camera behavior when testing apps by letting you upload an image and present it to the app as if it were read by the device camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bypass Screenshot Restriction <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">Android Only</span></p> | Enable/disable Bypass Screenshot Restriction (not supported on apps uploaded to the legacy sauce storage). If you're testing Android mobile apps on Sauce Labs and see a black screen in your live testing session, you might need to enable the <b>Bypass Screenshot Restriction</b>. This allows Sauce Labs to work around a setting on those apps that prevents screenshots or videos from being taken. However, there are other details to keep in mind. To effectively test apps that have this setting, see [Bypass Screenshot Restriction](/mobile-apps/features/bypass-screenshot). |
| System Alerts Display <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">iOS Only</span></p>             | Enable/disable a system alerts delay. Enabling delays alerts, such as asking for permission to access the camera, to prevent app crashes at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Enabling allows you to choose authentication options if your mobile app requires a biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or face recognition on Android, and Face ID or Touch ID on iOS.<br/> This setting is disabled by default for iOS apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Group Folder Redirect <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">iOS Only</span></p>             | Enable/disable a group directory redirect. Enabling allows you to use your app's private app container directory instead of the shared app group container directory. When your app gets resigned, the shared directory is not accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

:::note
Any changes you make to the app settings will affect all uploaded versions of the app.

### Selecting a Device

You must select a device prior to launching a session.

On the **App Management** page, hover over the app you want to test and then click **Start Test**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/live-testing/live-mobile-app-management-test.png')} alt="Choose a device" width="750"/>

The device selection page will open, with the option to test on a real device or a virtual device.

:::note
If you are testing an iOS app, the device selection will only display the type (real/virtual) configured on the app.
:::

To mark a device as a favorite so you can find it easily in the future, click the pin icon next to the device name.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/live-testing/device-favorite.png')} alt="Favorite a device" width="350"/>

The default sorting for the device list is **Pinned First**.

#### Real Devices

On the device selection page, click the **Mobile Real** tab. Use the search box and filters to find the device you want to test on, or select the device in the grid.

:::

### Launching a Test

You can launch a test from the following screens:

- Hover over the device in the grid and then click **Start Test**.
- Hover over the device in the grid and then click **Details**. On the **Details** screen, click **Start Test**.

:::caution

If you have issues starting live tests, check your IT infrastructure and make sure you are not blocking WebSockets.

:::

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/live-testing/live-mobile-app-management-start-test.png')} alt="Launch a test from the Details screen" width="750"/>

You'll see a loading screen, and then the app will launch in a live test window using the device you selected.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/live-testing/live-mobile-app-management-demo-app.png')} alt="Mobile real device test interface" width="550"/>

#### Time Limits and Timeouts for Real Devices

- Live tests for free users have a 10 minute limit from session start
- Live tests for all other users are limited to six hours
- Live tests for paid users will timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

### Trusting Enterprise Certificates

If you upload an app that is signed with an enterprise certificate, and **Instrumentation** is DISABLED in app settings, you must manually trust the certificate before it will successfully launch.

1. If you receive an app installation failed error, click the **X** in the app loading screen to exit the device home screen.
1. On the device home screen, navigate to **Settings** -> **General**.
1. Under **Profiles & Device Management**, tap the app you are trying to install and test.
1. Tap **Trust "app name"** and then tap **Trust**.
1. Reopen the app to continue the test.

### Adding a Test Name and Outcome for Your Test

Sauce Labs has introduced a new feature that allows you to enter a test name and test status (passed/failed) for your Live Tests after cross-browser and mobile app testing. This update enhances the testing efficiency by enabling you to add more context to test descriptions and add more clarity to your test repository.

Adding a test name is a straightforward process, and there are two ways to do it:

1. From the end session screen:

   - Start a Live Test session.
   - End the Live Test Session by clicking on the **End** button from the toolbar. The end session screen will pop up, and from there, you can edit the test name and select test outcome status:

     <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/mobile-live-failed-passed.png')} alt="Test Name" width="550"/>

1. From the test details page:
   - Go to **Live** -> **Test results** -> click on a test.
   - On the test details page, click on the pencil nearby the test name to edit it:
     <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/change-name-test-1.png')} alt="Test Name" width="550"/>

:::note
This feature works the same way for both cross-browser testing and mobile app testing.
:::

Use test names to customize your testing experience:

- Add descriptive names to your tests to quickly identify your findings.
- Keep track of tested steps by adding details to test names.
- Easily rename your tests to reflect Jira tickets or other related tasks.

:::note LIMITATIONS
This feature has a constraint on the maximum allowable length of the test name, which is limited to 255 characters. The utilization of emojis is not supported in the test name.

## Changing an App Version

Sometimes you need to conduct A/B testing, or document and validate feature parity between different versions of the same app. You can change the app version, as well as the real device, and launch a new test session.

1. On the **App Upload** page, click **+_#_** in the **Version** column.

2. On the **Settings** page, in the versions list, hover over the version you want to launch.
3. Click **Start Test**.
