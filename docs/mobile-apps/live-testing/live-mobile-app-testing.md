With Sauce Labs, you can test your mobile apps on a variety of Android and iOS/iPadOS devices. If you do not have an app, consider using the [Sauce Labs demo app](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-rn) for validating your account functionality as well as your tests.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
- Your mobile app file uploaded to our [App Storage](/mobile-apps/app-storage/). If you don't have one on hand, consider using our Demo Apps:
  - [React Native Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-rn/releases)
  - [iOS Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-ios/releases)
  - [Android Demo App](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-android/releases)

Image Injection allows you to mimic camera behavior when testing apps by letting you upload an image and present it to the app as if it were read by the device camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Bypass Screenshot Restriction](/mobile-apps/features/bypass-screenshot/) <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">Android Only</span></p> | Enable/disable Bypass Screenshot Restriction. If you're testing Android mobile apps on Sauce Labs and see a black screen in your live testing session, you might need to enable the <b>Bypass Screenshot Restriction</b>. This allows Sauce Labs to work around a setting on those apps that prevents screenshots or videos from being taken. However, there are other details to keep in mind. To effectively test apps that have this setting, see [Bypass Screenshot Restriction](/mobile-apps/features/bypass-screenshot). |
| System Alerts Display <br/><p><span className="sauceGreen">iOS Only</span></p>                                                       | Enable/disable a system alerts delay. Enabling delays alerts, such as asking for permission to access the camera, to prevent app crashes at startup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Enabling allows you to use your app's private app container directory instead of the shared app group container directory. When your app gets resigned, the shared directory is not accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

#### **Public vs. Private Devices**

There is a distinction between **Public Devices** and **Private Devices**.

- Public devices are accessible by anyone with a Sauce Labs account and are subject to availability. If a device is in use, you will see a **UNAVAILABLE** flag on the tile.

- [Private devices](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/private-device-mgmt/) are associated with your account and are an **enterprise only** feature. Private devices are indicated by the green **PRIVATE** on the tile.

:::note
If you are interested in upgrading to an enterprise plan, contact your Sauce Labs Sales Engineer or Customer Success Manager.

### Virtual Devices

On the device selection page, click the **Mobile Virtual** tab. Use the dropdowns to select the details for the virtual device you want to test on, and then click **Start Test**.

## Launching a Test
:::caution

If you have issues starting live tests, check your IT infrastructure and make sure you are not blocking WebSockets.

:::

You can launch a test from the following screens:

- Hover over the device in the grid and then click **Start Test**.
- Click on the device in the grid to open the **Device Details**. On the **Details** screen, click **Start Test**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/live-testing/live-mobile-app-management-start-test.png')} alt="Launch a test from the Details screen" width="750"/>


You'll see a loading screen, and then the app will launch in a live test window using the device you selected.

### Time Limits and Timeouts for Real Devices

- Live tests for free users have a 10 minute limit from session start
- Live tests for all other users are limited to six hours
- Live tests for paid users will timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

### Trusting Enterprise Certificates

If you upload an app that is signed with an enterprise certificate, and **Instrumentation** is DISABLED in app settings, you must manually trust the certificate before it will successfully launch.

1. If you receive an app installation failed error, click the **X** in the app loading screen to exit the device home screen.
1. On the device home screen, navigate to **Settings** -> **General**.
1. Under **Profiles & Device Management**, tap the app you are trying to install and test.
1. Tap **Trust "app name"** and then tap **Trust**.
1. Reopen the app to continue the test.

### Adding a Test Name and Outcome for Your Test

Sauce Labs has introduced a new feature that allows you to enter a test name and test status (passed/failed) for your Live Tests after cross-browser and mobile app testing. This update enhances the testing efficiency by enabling you to add more context to test descriptions and add more clarity to your test repository.

Adding a test name is a straightforward process, and there are two ways to do it:

1. From the end session screen:

   - Start a Live Test session.
   - End the Live Test Session by clicking on the **End** button from the toolbar. The end session screen will pop up, and from there, you can edit the test name and select test outcome status:

     <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/mobile-live-failed-passed.png')} alt="Test Name" width="550"/>

1. From the test details page:
   - Go to **Live** -> **Test results** -> click on a test.
   - On the test details page, click on the pencil nearby the test name to edit it:
     <img src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-apps/change-name-test-1.png')} alt="Test Name" width="550"/>

:::note
This feature works the same way for both cross-browser testing and mobile app testing.
:::

Use test names to customize your testing experience:

- Add descriptive names to your tests to quickly identify your findings.
- Keep track of tested steps by adding details to test names.
- Easily rename your tests to reflect Jira tickets or other related tasks.

:::note LIMITATIONS
This feature has a constraint on the maximum allowable length of the test name, which is limited to 255 characters. The utilization of emojis is not supported in the test name.
