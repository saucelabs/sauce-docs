With our MDM support, you gain the ability to install your internal application through MDM onto our private devices, enabling seamless policy enforcement and application management.

## What You'll Need

- A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
- Access to private devices.
- Service account to access your MDM(Intune) account.

## Key Features

**MDM Profile Application**
You can seamlessly apply and download the MDM profile to our private iOS devices. This ensures centralized management and control over the testing environment.

**App Policy Enforcement**
Sauce Labs supports the enforcement of app policies, allowing you to define and apply specific policies for each testing session. These policies are consistently reapplied to maintain a consistent testing environment.

**App VPN Support**
Setting up App VPNs is made easy, enabling you to connect to your internal firewalls without the need for Sauce Connect. Certain applications, like Edge, will automatically configure VPN extensions.

**App, System App, and Account Allow List**
See [Private Device Management](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/private-device-mgmt) for information on customizing app and account allow lists.

## Installing MDM

1. Start any Live Testing session with the private device where you want to install your MDM.
2. Sign in with your AppleID and download Intune or install your MDM using a specific link.
3. Login with your service account to your MDM/Intune portal.
4. After successful login, download and install the MDM profile through **Settings**.
5. Navigate to **Settings > VPN and Device Management**, click on **Management Profile**, and install the MDM.
6. Once installed, click on the **Home Screen**.
7. Confirm that all the apps related to your company-managed profile have been successfully downloaded.

## Restrictions and Recommendations

While our MDM support offers a robust framework for device management, certain limitations and recommendations should be considered during implementation:

- **Sauce-Specific MDM Policy** - You should create a Sauce-specific MDM policy, emphasizing requirements such as passcode lock settings, OS version compatibility, and application installation preferences.
- **Passcode Lock and Setup** - Avoid enforcing passcode lock or device setup to maintain user flexibility.
- **OS Version Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility with a range of iOS versions, not exclusively the latest.
- **USB Data Transfer**- Maintain USB data transfer functionality for efficient interactions.
- **Screen Recording**- We recommend that the screen recording feature is enabled.
- **Application Installation** - Enable installation of applications to the device.
