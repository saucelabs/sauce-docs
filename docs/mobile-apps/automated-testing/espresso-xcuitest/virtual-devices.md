Sauce Runner for Virtual Devices provides the ability to run automated Android app UI tests on Sauce Labs emulators from your local Espresso environment.

>**NOTE**: At this time, XCUITest is not supported.

## What You'll Need

* Your Sauce Labs username and access key.
* Your mobile app file and mobile test file. Accepted file types are .ipa for iOS and .apk for Android.
  * For details on how to build .ipa files for use with Sauce Runner for Real Devices, see [Creating .ipa Files for Appium and XCUITest](mobile-apps/automated-testing/ipa-files.md).

If you'd like to try out this functionality but don't have an app on hand, [download our Sauce Labs demo app file and test file](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-espresso/tree/master/emulators).

## System Requirements
* Network connectivity to saucelabs.com on `port 443`.
* 4GB of free RAM on your local machine.
* A 64-bit operating system running Windows 7+, Mac OS X 10.11+, or Linux.

### Supported Espresso Package Versions
| Package | Minimum Version |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core | 3.0.2 |

| com.android.support.test:runner | 1.0.2 |
| com.android.support.test:rules | 1.0.2 |
| junit:junit | 4.12 |

## Download Runner
1. To get started, download one of Sauce Runner for Virtual Devices packages to your local machine.

| Download Link | SHA1 Checksum
| :-------------------------- | :---
| [Mac OS X 10.11+](https://saucelabs.com/downloads/sauce-runner-virtual-0.1.2-osx.zip) | 0cfc478d0649968d494441c1bfe71b77d13e7fd8
| [Windows 7+ 64-bit](https://saucelabs.com/downloads/sauce-runner-virtual-0.1.2-windows.zip) | aece75d0bc5fb68eba45e3c2f0cfdb381933ae78
| [Linux 64-bit](https://saucelabs.com/downloads/sauce-runner-virtual-0.1.2-linux.zip) | 18bc0a7573ff8182b6f01d2e09353d0b75efa9dd

## Set Up Project Folder

2. Unzip the download package contents to any folder on your local machine.

3. Create a new folder for your project and drop the `saucelabs-native-test-runner` application, your app .apk file, and test .apk file here, so that your folder structure looks like this:

  ```bash
  |_{root / your project folder}
    |_saucelabs-native-test-runner.jar
    |_SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.App.apk
    |_SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.Tests.apk
  ```

## Gather Your Credentials

4. Find your Sauce Labs `username`, `accessKey`, and the emulator `deviceName` you wish to test on. The list of devices is located under **Live** > **Cross-Browser** > **Mobile Virtual**.
   * **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**: Setting your Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` as [environment variables](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48365647#BestPracticesforRunningTests-UseEnvironmentVariablesforAuthenticationCredentials) provides an extra layer of security for your credentials when you reference them from within your tests.

## Configure Your Test

:::tip CLI Reference
See [Sauce Runner for Virtual Devices CLI Reference](/dev/cli/espresso-xcuitest/virtual-devices). To view these commands in your CLI, run the `--help` option:
```java
java -jar saucelabs-native-test-runner.jar --help
```
:::
<br/>

5. Open a new command line window, then enter the [required commands and flags](/dev/cli/espresso-xcuitest/virtual-devices):

   ```java title="Required Commands and Flags"
   ./sauce-runner-virtual -f <your test framework (espresso or xcuitest)> -u <your username> -k <your access key> --app <your app file name> --test-app <your test file name> -d ''<your device name>''
   ```

   ```java title="Basic Example"
   ./sauce-runner-virtual -f espresso -u john.smith -k ab015c1e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx --app ./SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.App.apk --test-app ./SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.Tests.apk -d 'deviceName=Google Pixel GoogleAPI Emulator,platformVersion=7.1'
   ```

  In this example, Sauce Runner will install the Android app (SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.App.apk) on the Google Pixel emulator and then launch the Espresso test suite (SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.Tests.apk).

  If needed, you can also add [optional parameters](/dev/cli/espresso-xcuitest/virtual-devices) to configure Sauce Runner with your Espresso tests. For example, you could add another device to the above code script by adding the line `--d 'deviceName=Samsung Galaxy S8 HD GoogleAPI Emulator,platformVersion=7.0'`.

## Run Your Test

6. In your command line window, execute the above commands and options. This will launch the Sauce Runner connection and begin running your test. Our emulators are capable of running Espresso jobs for up to three hours, however, a one-hour execution time is recommended.

7. Sauce Runner for Virtual Devices will return the following exit status codes, based on test execution results:
   * Status Code 0: all the tests passed on all devices.
   * Status Code 1: this can mean multiple things: one or more tests failed during execution, user error (e.g., invalid path to test files, invalid arguments), Sauce Labs infrastructure error while executing the test. Please refer to your log to identify the problem.

## Closing Your Test

8. Sauce Runner will exit when all the tests have completed.

Go to the [Sauce Labs Training GitHub repository](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-espresso/tree/master/emulators) to browse more example scripts and Espresso test cases on Sauce Labs Emulators.

## Troubleshooting

## System Animations Disabled

To help prevent flakey Espresso tests, we've followed Google's recommendation to [disable system animations on Sauce Labs Android emulators](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/setup):

* Window animation scale
* Transition animation scale
* Animator duration scale

### Internal Server Error

When testing on Sauce Labs emulators, one possible error is **Internal Server Error**. This happens when an Espresso test suite runs as expected on one Android version, but fails on another version.

**Potential Cause**: Minimum Android version not met for your application under test.

**Recommendation**: Check the `minSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` for your application project.
