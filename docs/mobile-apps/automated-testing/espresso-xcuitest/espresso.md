`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your Espresso tests, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running Espresso tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/ide/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::


## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-espresso-example/blob/master/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running Espresso tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```
---

## `kind`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: espresso
```
---

## `showConsoleLog`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Generates the `console.log` as local output and as a test asset in Sauce Labs for all tests. By default, `console.log` is only included in results for failed tests.

```yaml
showConsoleLog: true
```
---

## `defaults`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any default settings for the project.

```yaml
defaults:
  timeout: 15m
```
---

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long (in `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`) `saucectl` should wait for each suite to complete. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `timeout` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `0` (unlimited).

:::caution Real Device Max Duration
When setting the timeout values for your suites, consider that native framework tests on real devices enforce a maximum test duration limit of 60 minutes.
:::

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

## `sauce`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  concurrency: 5
```
---

### `region`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

  region: eu-central-1
```
---

### `metadata`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT | VIRTUAL ONLY |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps you distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
metadata:
  build: RC 10.4.a
  tags:
    - e2e
    - Android
    - beta
    - featurex
```
---

### `concurrency`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the maximum number of suites to execute at the same time. If the test defines more suites than the max, excess suites are queued and run in order as each suite completes.

:::caution
Set this value to equal or less than your Sauce concurrency allowance, as setting a higher value may result in jobs dropped by the server.
:::

```yaml
  concurrency: 5
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the concurrency flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --ccy 5
```
---

### `retries`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of times to retry a failed suite.

```yaml

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the retries flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --retries 1
```
---

### `tunnel`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels/) to establish a secure connection with Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the name and owner (if applicable) in this property.

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```
---

#### `name`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies an active Sauce Connect tunnel to use for secure connectivity to the Sauce Labs cloud.

    - ./apps/pre-installed-app2.apk
```
---

### `app`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

The path to the app. The default directory is `{project-root}/apps/filename.apk`, and the property supports expanded environment variables to designate the path, as shown in the following examples, or an already uploaded app reference. Supports \*.apk and \*.aab files.

:::caution AAB App Signing
To install an \*.apk app that is extracted from an \*.aab file, Sauce Labs must sign the \*.apk using its own signature. In such cases, Sauce Labs signs both the `app` and `testApp` to ensure matching signatures, even if instrumentation is disabled. Otherwise, the app installation will fail.
:::

```yaml
  app: ./apps/calc.apk
```

```yaml
  app: $APP
```

```yaml
  app: storage:099557f6-aabb-f8b3-6ad1-8f6200898b92
```

```yaml
  app: storage:filename=calc.apk
```

---

### `testApp`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

The path to the testing app. The relative file location is `{project-root}/apps/testfile.apk`, and the property supports expanded environment variables to designate the path, as shown in the following examples, or an already uploaded test app reference. Supports \*.apk and \*.aab files.

:::caution AAB App Signing
To install an \*.apk app that is extracted from an \*.aab file, Sauce Labs must sign the \*.apk using its own signature. In such cases, Sauce Labs signs both the `app` and `testApp` to ensure matching signatures, even if instrumentation is disabled. Otherwise, the app installation will fail.
:::

```yaml
  testApp: ./apps/calc-success.apk
```

```yaml
  testApp: $TEST_APP
```

```yaml
  testApp: storage:fbd59e8e-2555-0d3c-5583-1bba2cd17b64
```

```yaml
  testApp: storage:filename=calc-success.apk
```

---

### `otherApps`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ARRAY | REAL DEVICES ONLY |</small></p>

Set of up to seven apps to pre-install for your tests. You can upload an \*.apk  or \*.aab app file from your local machine by specifying a filepath (relative location is `{project-root}/apps/app1.apk`) or an expanded environment variable representing the path, or you can specify an app that has already been uploaded to [Sauce Labs App Storage](/mobile-apps/app-storage) by providing the reference `storage:<fileId>` or `storage:filename=<filename>`.

:::note
Apps specified as `otherApps` inherit the configuration of the main app under test for [`Device Language`, `Device Orientation`, and `Proxy`](https://app.saucelabs.com/live/app-testing#group-details), regardless of any differences that may be applied through the Sauce Labs UI, because the settings are specific to the device under test. For example, if the dependent app is intended to run in landscape orientation, but the main app is set to portrait, the dependent app will run in portrait for the test, which may have unintended consequences.
:::

```yaml
  otherApps:
    - ./apps/pre-installed-app1.apk
    - $PRE_INSTALLED_APP2
    - storage:d6aac80c-2000-a2f1-4c4e-539266e93ee6

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, potentially overriding the default project timeout setting.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

### `emulators`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

---

#### `size`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ENUM |</small></p>

Instructs `saucectl` to run only tests that are annotated with the matching size value i.e `@SmallTest`, `@MediumTest` or `@LargeTest`. Valid values are `small`, `medium`, or `large`. You may only specify one value for this property.

```yaml
  size: small
```
---

#### `package`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Instructs `saucectl` to run only tests in the specified package.

```yaml
  package: com.example.android.testing.androidjunitrunnersample
```
---

#### `numShards`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of separate shards to create for the test suite. Read more about shard tests on the [Android developer site](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner#sharding-tests).

When sharding is configured, `saucectl` automatically creates the sharded jobs for each of the devices defined for the suite based on the number of shards you specify. For example, for a suite testing a single emulator version that specifies 2 shards, `saucectl` clones the suite and runs one shard index on the first suite, and the other shard index on the identical clone suite. For a suite that is testing 2 emulator version and two real devices, `saucectl` must clone the suite to run each shard index for each emulator and device, so 8 jobs in total for the suite.

:::note
Espresso may not distribute tests evenly across the number of shards specified, especially if the number of shards is near or equivalent to the number of tests in the suite. In such cases, it is not unusual to see jobs with no tests at all because they were already executed in other shard jobs.
:::

```yaml
  numShards: 2
```
---

#### `clearPackageData`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN | REAL DEVICES ONLY |</small></p>

Removes all shared states from the testing device's CPU and memory at the completion of each test.

:::note
The flag `clearPackageData` has to be used in conjunction with `useTestOrchestrator`.
:::

```yaml
  clearPackageData: true
  useTestOrchestrator: true
```
---

#### `useTestOrchestrator`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN | REAL DEVICES ONLY |</small></p>

Run each of your tests in its own Instrumentation instance to remove most of the app's shared state from the device CPU and memory between tests. Use this setting in conjunction with `clearPackageData: true` to completely remove all shared state.

When set, the instrumentation starts with [Test Orchestrator version 1.1.1](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-runner#using-android-test-orchestrator) in use. This property applies only to real devices, not emulators.

```yaml
  useTestOrchestrator: true
```
---

### `appSettings`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Application settings for real device tests.

```yaml
appSettings:
  audioCapture: true

```yaml
  instrumentation:
    networkCapture: true
```
---

##### `networkCapture`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Record network traffic for HTTP/HTTPS requests during app tests on real devices. 

```yaml
    networkCapture: true
```

## Advanced Configuration Considerations

The configuration file is flexible enough to allow for any customizations and definitions that are required for any of the supported frameworks. The following sections describe some of the most common configurations.

### Setting up a Proxy

If you need to go through a proxy server, you can set it through the following variables:

* `HTTP_PROXY`: Proxy to use to access HTTP websites
* `HTTPS_PROXY`: Proxy to use to access HTTPS websites

``` title= "Example: Windows Powershell"
PS> $Env:HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
PS> $Env:HTTPS_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
```

``` title= "Example: Linux/macOS"
$> export HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
$> export HTTPS_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
```

## Try Espresso with Cucumber

`saucectl` supports Espresso using Cucumber, and the Espresso demo repo includes an [example Cucumber setup](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-espresso-example/tree/master/examples/cucumber).
