`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your XCUITest tests, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running XCUITest tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/ide/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::

## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-xcuitest-example/blob/master/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running XCUITest tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```

---

## `kind`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: xcuitest
```

---

## `showConsoleLog`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Controls whether the contents of `console.log` are always shown in the local output of saucectl. By default (false), `console.log` is only shown for failed suites.

```yaml
showConsoleLog: true
```

---

## `defaults`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any default settings for the project.

```yaml
defaults:
  timeout: 15m
```

---

### `timeout`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long (in `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`) `saucectl` should wait for each suite to complete. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `timeout` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `0` (unlimited).

:::caution Real Device Max Duration
When setting the timeout values for your suites, consider that native framework tests on real devices enforce a maximum test duration limit of 90 minutes.
:::

```yaml
defaults:
  timeout: 15m
```

---

## `sauce`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  concurrency: 5
```

---

### `region`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

:::note
If you do not specify a region in your config file, you must set it when running your command with the `--region` flag.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
```

---

### `metadata`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT | VIRTUAL ONLY |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you.

:::note
At this time, the `metadata` property is not supported for XCUITest because XCUITest is only supported for real device testing.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  metadata:
    build: RC 10.4.i
    tags:
      - e2e
      - iPad
      - beta
      - featurex
```

---

### `concurrency`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the maximum number of suites to execute at the same time. If the test defines more suites than the max, excess suites are queued and run in order as each suite completes.

:::caution
Set this value to equal or less than your Sauce concurrency allowance, as setting a higher value may result in jobs dropped by the server.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  concurrency: 5
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the concurrency flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --ccy 5
```

---

### `retries`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of times to retry a failed suite. For more settings, you can
refer to [passThreshold](#passthreshold).

```yaml
sauce:
  retries: 1
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the retries flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --retries 1
```

---

### `tunnel`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels/) to establish a secure connection with Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the name and owner (if applicable) in this property.

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

---

#### `name`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies an active Sauce Connect tunnel to use for secure connectivity to the Sauce Labs cloud.

```

---

#### `owner`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the Sauce Labs user who created the specified tunnel, which is required if the user running the tests did not create the tunnel.

:::note
This property replaces the former `parent` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml

  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

---

### `launchOrder`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies the execution order for your test suites. When set to `fail rate`, test suites with the highest failure rate will execute first. If unspecified, test suites will execute in the order in which they are written in the configuration file.

  launchOrder: fail rate
```

---

## `env`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT | <span className="sauceGreen">Virtual Devices Only</span> |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that are global for all tests suites in this configuration. Values set in this global property will overwrite values set for the same environment variables set at the suite level.

    - ./apps/pre-installed-app1.ipa # This is an example app for real devices.
    - ./apps/pre-installed-app2.ipa # This is an example app for real devices.
```

:::caution

`saucectl` supports running XCUITests on Real Devices and Simulators which can be configured by using:

- `devices`, see [Devices](#devices)
- `simulators`, see [Simulators](#simulators)

They can **NOT** be used in the same [`suites`](#suites) configuration due to `app` and `testApp` architecture differences between Real Devices and Simulators (enforced by Apple). If you want to use both Real Devices and Simulators, you need to create two separate [`suites`](#suites) configurations and provide [`app`](#app-1) and [`testApp`](#testapp-1) configuration for each suite.

Follow the instructions to build [iOS Real Device `.ipa` files](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/ipa-files/) or [iOS Simulator `.app` files](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/app-files/).

:::

### `otherApps`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ARRAY |</small></p>

Set of up to seven (real devices) or two (virtual devices) apps to pre-install for your tests. See [`app`](#app) for more app details.

:::note

1. Real Device and Simulator apps can **NOT** be combined, see [`xcuitest`](#xcuitest) for more details.
2. Apps specified as `otherApps` inherit the configuration of the main app under test for [`Device Language`, `Device Orientation`, and `Proxy`](https://app.saucelabs.com/live/app-testing#group-details), regardless of any differences that may be applied through the Sauce Labs UI, because the settings are specific to the device under test. For example, if the dependent app is intended to run in landscape orientation, but the main app is set to portrait, the dependent app will run in portrait for the test, which may have unintended consequences.

:::

```yaml
xcuitest:
  otherApps:
    - ./apps/pre-installed-app1.ipa                           # This is an example app for real devices.
    - https://example.app.download.url/pre-installed-app1.ipa # This is an example app for real devices.

    testAppDescription: My Demo test runner app
```

---

### `timeout`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, potentially overriding the default project timeout setting.

When the suite reaches the timeout limit, its status is set to '?' in the CLI. This does not reflect the actual status of the job in the Sauce Labs web UI or API.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    timeout: 15m
```

---

### `passThreshold`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Specifies the minimum number of successful attempts for a suite to be considered as `passed`. It should be used along with [retries](#retries).

:::note
For example, setting `retries` to 3 and `passThreshold` to 2.
The max attempt would be 4 times. If the test passed twice, it'd stop and be marked as `passed`. Otherwise, it'd be marked as `failed`.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    smartRetry:
      failedOnly: true
```

---

#### `failedClassesOnly`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

<p><small>| MANDATORY <span className="sauceGreen">for Virtual Devices</span> | OPTIONAL <span className="sauceGreen">for Real Devices</span> | STRING |</small></p>

Allows you to set the mobile OS platform version that you want to use in your test.

:::note
Android and iOS platform versions are based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), also known as SEMVER. This means that the versions will have the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
:::

**Virtual Devices**

This is mandatory for Android Emulators and iOS Simulators. You can find the available versions in our [Platform Configurator](https://saucelabs.com/platform/platform-configurator).

**Real Devices**

This is optional for Real Devices. There are three options you can use to determine which version you want to use for your automated Appium, Espresso, or XCUITest tests:

1. Don't provide a `platformVersion`, this will result in any available Android or iOS device, no matter the version.
2. Provide a `platformVersion` that starts with your provided `platformVersion` string:
   - **`12`:** matches all minors and patches for `platformVersion: "12"`. For example `12.1.0|12.1.1|12.2.0|...`
   - **`12.1`:** matches all patches for `platformVersion: "12.1"`. For example `12.1.0|12.1.1`, it will **not** match `12.2.x|12.3.x` and higher
   - **`12.1.1`:** matches all devices that have **this exact** platform version
3. In/exclude a specific version and or a range of versions by using a regular expression (regex). You don't need to provide the forward slashes (`/{your-regex}/`) as you would normally do with regex. Keep in mind that the regex needs to match the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The possibilities are endless, but here are just a few examples:
   - **`^1[3-4|6].*`:** Will match `13`, `14` and `16`, but not 15, see [example](https://regex101.com/r/ExICgZ/1).
   - **`^(?!15).*`:** Will exclude version `15` with all it's minors and patches, but will match all other versions, see [example](https://regex101.com/r/UqqYrM/1).

:::note
The stricter the `platformVersions` is, the smaller the pool of available devices will be and the longer you might need to wait for the available device. We recommend using only the major version or using the regex option to get the best results and an available device in the fastest way.

---

#### `testTimeoutsEnabled`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | string | <span className="sauceGreen">Simulators Only</span> |</small></p>

By default there is no timeout, if enabled, then the timeout is 600 seconds. The values can be `Yes` or `No`. The timeout itself can be changed by adding the `defaultTestExecutionTimeAllowance` value. See also [executionTimeAllowance | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/3526064-executiontimeallowance)

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    testOptions:
      testTimeoutsEnabled: "Yes"
```

---

#### `defaultTestExecutionTimeAllowance`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | integer | <span className="sauceGreen">Simulators Only</span> |</small></p>

The default execution time an individual test is given to execute if [`testTimeoutsEnabled`](#testtimeoutsenabled) is enabled. The value is in seconds and rounds up the value you supply to the nearest minute. See also [executionTimeAllowance | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/3526064-executiontimeallowance)

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    testOptions:
      defaultTestExecutionTimeAllowance: 200
```

---

#### `maximumTestExecutionTimeAllowance`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | integer | <span className="sauceGreen">Simulators Only</span> |</small></p>

The maximum execution time an individual test is given to execute, regardless of the test's preferred allowance. The value is in seconds and rounds up the value you supply to the nearest minute. See also [executionTimeAllowance | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestcase/3526064-executiontimeallowance)

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    testOptions:
      maximumTestExecutionTimeAllowance: 300
```

---

#### `testLanguage`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | string | <span className="sauceGreen">Simulators Only</span> |</small></p>

Specifies ISO 639-1 language during testing. See also [ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php)

:::caution

While it's possible to change the test language, it's not always guaranteed to work depending on your specific setup. Programmatically changing the `launchArguments` in your test itself is often a more reliable method ([Example](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-ios/blob/2.0.2/MyDemoAppUITests/Tests/LocalizationTest.swift)). If the command line arguments continue to not work as expected, it would be worth reaching out to Apple's developer support for more guidance.

:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    testOptions:
      testLanguage: "de"
```

---

#### `testRegion`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | integer | <span className="sauceGreen">Simulators Only</span> |</small></p>

Specifies ISO 3166-1 region during testing with the format `{shortNameCode}_(alpha2Code}`. See also [ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/)

:::caution

While it's possible to change the test region, it's not always guaranteed to work depending on your specific setup. Programmatically changing the `launchArguments` in your test itself is often a more reliable method ([Example](https://github.com/saucelabs/my-demo-app-ios/blob/2.0.2/MyDemoAppUITests/Tests/LocalizationTest.swift)). If the command line arguments continue to not work as expected, it would be worth reaching out to Apple's developer support for more guidance.

:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    testOptions:
      testRegion: "de_DE"
```

---

### `shard`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

When shard is configured as `concurrency`, saucectl automatically splits the tests into several groups (the number of groups is determined by the concurrency setting). Each group will then run as an individual job.

Selectable values: `concurrency` to shard by concurrency. Remove this field or leave it empty `""` for no sharding.

:::note
When shard is set for a suite, the [class](#class) setting is automatically ignored.
:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "I am sharded"
    shard: concurrency
```

---

### `testListFile`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

The file containing a list of tests is used in sharding by concurrency. It's a `txt` file and each line contains a test. Click [Sharding XCUITest introduction](./xcuitest-introduction.md#sharding-xcuitest) to see how to generate this file.

```
# Devices
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests.LoginTests/testSuccessfulLogin
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests.LoginTests/testNoUsernameLogin
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests.LoginTests
# Simulators
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests/LoginTests/testSuccessfulLogin
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests/LoginTests/testNoUsernameLogin
SwagLabsMobileAppUITests/LoginTests
```

## Advanced Configuration Considerations

The configuration file is flexible enough to allow for any customizations and definitions that are required for any of the supported frameworks. The following sections describe some of the most common configurations.

### Setting up a Proxy

If you need to go through a proxy server, you can set it through the following variables:

- `HTTP_PROXY`: Proxy to use to access HTTP websites
- `HTTPS_PROXY`: Proxy to use to access HTTPS websites

```title= "Example: Windows Powershell"
PS> $Env:HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
PS> $Env:HTTPS_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
```

```title= "Example: Linux/macOS"
$> export HTTP_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
$> export HTTPS_PROXY=http://my.proxy.org:3128/
```
