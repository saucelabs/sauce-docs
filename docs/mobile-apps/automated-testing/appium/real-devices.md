This topic describes automated Appium testing on the Sauce Labs Real Device Cloud (RDC). You can accelerate your test execution by running parallel automated tests across thousands of mobile device/OS combinations, in our public real device cloud and/or a private device pool of your own.

## What You'll Need

* Your Sauce Labs username and access key.
* Ensure that your mobile app and project setup meet our [real device cloud requirements](mobile-apps/supported-devices).
* Have your mobile app file (.ipa for iOS, .apk for Android) and mobile test file on hand.

If you don't have an app and would like to try out our test functionality, feel free to download and use our [Sauce Labs demo app](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases).

## Uploading and Accessing Your Apps on Real Devices

Select your preferred testing platform for uploading your app in order to view the instructions.

  ]}>

<TabItem value="Using a Remote Location">

**Installing Mobile Apps from a Remote Location**

There may be situations where you want to install an app from a downloadable remote location (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, a GitHub repository). The app is completely removed from the real device after the test completes, providing an added layer of security for your app.

Please review the following guidelines below before uploading your app:

1. Make sure your app meets the [requirements](mobile-apps/supported-devices) for Android and iOS Mobile App Testing.
2. Upload your app to the hosting location.
3. Ensure Sauce Labs has READ access to the app URL.
4. In your Appium test script, enter the URL for the app as the "app" desired capability. Example Java Snippet:
  ```java
  caps.setCapability("app", "https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases/download/2.3.0/Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.2.3.0.apk?raw=true");
  ```

**Installing your App on Private Devices**

In some cases, you may need to upload / install your app to a private device and also prevent the device from broad internet access while under test. The steps to achieve this are:

* Upload your app to an internal git repository, or private hosting solution with the necessary permissions (e.g. Amazon S3 with a strict bucket policy).
* Ensure the hosted app URL is available to the machine running the automated test.
* Ensure that you've enabled the **Require Sauce Connect/VPN** setting in your [organization's security settings](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=69108863).

>**NOTE**: Each session is a "fresh" installation of your app, meaning, you will not be able to access information about previous versions of your app.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Using the REST API">

**Uploading Mobile Apps with the Sauce Labs REST API**

Below are some examples of how to use the Sauce Labs REST API to upload your mobile app to our App Storage and get your real device project started. See also: [Mobile App Testing API](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80416665).

**REST API Authentication**

For APIs and authorization credentials, use the Sauce Labs Storage REST API (app.saucelabs.com).

A recommended best practice is to set your credentials as environment variables, like so:

```java
SAUCE_USERNAME='valid.username'
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY='valid.key'
```

For specific instructions on how to set environment variables, visit the following links:

* [Set Environment Variables with Windows 10](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
* [Set Environment Variables with MacOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)
* [Set Environment Variables with Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)

**Supported Use Cases for Sauce Labs Real Device Testing**

* Execute Appium tests against a private real device hosted in the U.S., using your Sauce Labs username and access key
* Use Sauce Storage, for Appium testing, as you usually do for emulators and simulators tests
* Analyze Appium test executions, on Sauce Labs similar to the way you do it for desktop, emulators and simulators
* Consume Real Device Cloud (RDC) API similar to the way you do for emulators and simulators (with applicable RDC settings)

**Example Test Script**

```java
private URL createUrl() throws MalformedURLException {
    return new URL("https://$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/wd/hub");
}

@BeforeEach
void setUp() throws MalformedURLException {
    DesiredCapabilities desiredCapabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
    desiredCapabilities.setCapability("platformName", "iOS");
    IOSDriver driver = new IOSDriver(createUrl(), desiredCapabilities);
}
```

**App Storage and Data Center Endpoints**

Below are some examples of how to use the Sauce Labs REST API to upload your mobile app to Sauce Storage. For details related to authorization credentials, see [Data Center Endpoints](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102704068).

To connect to the real device cloud in your automated Appium tests, you'll need to use include either the EU or US storage endpoint in your test script. This example (macOS / Linux) how to upload an app to App Storage in the US-West Data Center:

```sh
$ curl -F "payload=@/Users/$SAUCE_USERNAME/Downloads/$FILE_NAME.ipa" -F "name=$FILE_NAME.ipa" -u "$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"  'https://api.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/v1/storage/upload'
```

>**NOTE**: For more detailed information on how to access the app in your automated test builds and use the Storage API, see [App Storage](/mobile-apps/app-storage.md).

Below are some additional examples using the EU and US endpoints.

US Data Center (macOS / Linux)

```sh
$ curl -u "$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST -w "%{http_code}\n" \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
"https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/storage/$SAUCE_USERNAME/Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.x.x.x.apk?overwrite=true" \
--data-binary @/path/to/Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.x.x.x.apk
```

US Data Center (Windows)

```
> curl -u "%SAUCE_USERNAME%:%SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY% -X POST -w "%{http_code}\n" \
-H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
"https://saucelabs.com/rest/v1/storage/%SAUCE_USERNAME%/Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.x.x.x.apk?overwrite=true" \
--data-binary @\path\to\Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.x.x.x.apk
```

## Configuring Appium Tests for Real Devices

This section describes parameters that we recommend using to configure your Appium tests on Sauce Labs real devices. See [Appium for Real Devices CLI Reference](dev/cli/appium/real-devices) for the full list of required and optional parameters.

:::caution Please Read

Certain Appium capabilities behave differently when running Appium tests on our Real Device Cloud versus a local Appium server. On our Real Device Cloud:

* [Some Appium capabilities are not supported](dev/cli/appium/real-devices).
* Emulator-only capabilities will not work.
* The `app` capability will be always be overwritten; it will point to the app file you uploaded to our system.
* The `noReset` capability will only work if device caching is enabled.
* Different setups may have different ways of handling capabilities and/or different requirements. Check to make sure you're providing all of the required capabilities.
:::

#### **Setting Your `appiumVersion`**

If you omit the `appiumVersion` in your test configuration, your test will be running with our default Appium version. We recommend that you specify one of the newer Appium versions that provides a more extended API and fixes to known bugs.

#### **Checking the Appium Version for Your Test**
1. Log in to Sauce Labs.
2. Go to **Test Details**.
3. Find and select the test that you ran using Appium.
4. Click the **Metadata** tab.
5. Look for the **Logs** row and select **Appium Log**. The first line should indicate the Appium version. For example, `2019-05-05T17:45:07.541Z - info: Welcome to Appium v1.10.1`.

#### **Setting the `browserName`**

When testing a native mobile app, the value for `browserName` is an empty string, as in `caps.setCapability("browserName", "");`.

#### **Setting the Location of Your Mobile App**

If the app you want to test has been uploaded to a location other than Sauce Storage, you need to specify this location for `app`, and make sure that this location is accessible to Sauce Labs browsers. For example, `caps.setCapability("app","sauce-storage:mapp.zip");`.

#### **Setting the `automationName` for Android Apps**

If you're testing a native mobile app against Android versions 4.0-4.1, or a hybrid mobile against Android versions 4.0 - 4.2, you need to set the capability `"automationName","selendroid"`.

These Android versions are only supported via Appium’s bundled version of Selendroid, which utilizes [Instrumentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Instrumentation.html). Later versions of Android are supported via Appium’s own UiAutomator library.

#### **Enabling Location Services for iOS Devices**

If you want to enable location services on an iOS simulator - to test GPS-dependent apps, for example - set these capabilities in your Appium script:

```java
locationServicesEnabled=true
locationServicesAuthorized=true
```

### Native vs. Hybrid Apps

**iPhone 6 Real Device**

```java
{
deviceName:'iPhone 6 Device',
platformName:'iOS',
platformVersion:'8.4',
app:'sauce-storage:SampleIOSApp.ipa',
"appium-version":"1.4.16"
}
```

**Samsung Galaxy S5 Real Device**

```java
{
deviceName:'Samsung Galaxy S5 Device',
platformVersion:'4.4',
platformName:'Android',
"appActivity": ".ContactManager",
"appPackage": "com.example.android.contactmanager",
app:"http://saucelabs.com/example_files/ContactManager.apk",
"appium-version":"1.4.16"
}
```

**Samsung Galaxy S4**

```java
{
deviceName:'Samsung Galaxy S4 Device',
platformVersion:'4.4',
platformName:'Android',
"appActivity": ".ContactManager",
"appPackage": "com.example.android.contactmanager",
app:"http://saucelabs.com/example_files/ContactManager.apk",
"appium-version":"1.4.16"
}
```

### Dynamic Device Allocation

_Dynamic Allocation_ involves providing basic parameters for the platform and operating system, or the type of device you want to use in your tests, and a device with those specifications is selected from the device pool. While static allocation allows you more fine-grained control over the device used in your tests, it can also cause delays in your test execution if that device isn't available when you run your tests. If you only need to test on a particular platform and OS version, such as an Android 4.1, or on a particular type of device, you should use dynamic allocation, and we recommend that you use dynamic allocation for all automated mobile application testing in CI/CD environments.

#### **Required Capabilities for Dynamic Allocation**

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Capability</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Capability Explanation</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>platformName</code>
   </td>
   <td><p>Defines the type of mobile platform to use in your tests (i.e., Android or iOS). The values for capabilities are not case-sensitive, so <code>android</code> is the same as <code>Android</code>, and <code>ios</code> is the same as <code>iOS</code>.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>platformVersion</code>
   </td>
   <td><p>The platform version to use in your tests, for example "4" or "4.1". This is a substring match. You can specify both major versions and incremental versions of an operating system.</p><p>For example, if you set only a major version 4, you also have access to all devices running incremental versions (e.g., "4.1"," 4.2", "4.2.1", "4.4.4").</p><p>This also extends to minor and point versions. For example, if you specify "11.4", it will match "11.4.0", "11.4.1".</p>

    "iPhone.*", "iPhone .*"
</sub>
<p>To allocate any device with the word "nexus" in its display name.</p><sub>

    ".*nexus.*"

    "iPhone [67]S" or "iPhone [6-7]S"
</sub>
<p>To allocate "iPhone 7" or "iPhone 7S", or any device that starts with the display name "iPhone 7".</p><sub>

    "iPhone 7.*"
</sub>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Regular expressions are not case sensitive.</p>

   <td><strong>Capability</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>privateDeviceOnly</code>
   </td>

   </td>
   <td><p>Only allocate devices if they are connected to a carrier network with "true".</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Static Device Allocation

With _Static Allocation_, you can specify the device to use in your tests, but if that device is not available when you run your tests, it will delay test execution. For this reason, you should always make sure that the device you want to use is available before launching your tests. The `platformName` and `platformVersion` capabilities will be set by default, and if these are included in your test script, they will be ignored.

| Capability | Setting |
|------------|----|
| `deviceName` | The ID of the device you want to use in your test, for example `LG_Nexus_5X_real`. You can find the ID for a device by locating it in the real device selection menu of the Sauce Labs application, and then click the **Details** link for the device. |


### Device Caching

#### **`cacheId` Capability**

By default, every time you complete a test session, the real device cloud uninstalls your app, performs device cleaning, and de-allocates the device. This means that if you're running multiple tests on the same device, you would need to wait for this cleaning process to complete between every test.

To get around this, you can use the capability `cacheId`, which keeps the device allocated to you for 10 seconds after each test completes. If you immediately start another test on the device, you won't need to wait for the allocation and device cleaning process to be repeated. In this case, no device cleaning will take place in between sessions, with the only exception being the application under test and the data it owns.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Capability</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Setting</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>cacheId</code></td>
   <td><p>A random string. This value for cacheId must be the same for all test methods that you want to run on the cached device. In addition, the application and project ID used for the tests must remain the same, along with the values for these capabilities:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>deviceName</code></li>
<li><code>platformName</code></li>
<li><code>platformVersion</code></li>
<li><code>tabletOnly</code></li>
<li><code>phoneOnly</code></li>
<li><code>privateDevicesOnly</code></li>
<li><code>automationName</code></li>
<li><code>autoGrantPermissions</code></li>
<li><code>appiumVersion</code></li>

</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


#### Using Device Caching with `noReset`

You can also use the `cacheId` capability in conjunction with the standard noReset Appium capability. In the default case, where noReset is set to false, your application will be uninstalled and reinstalled after every test. If `noReset` is set to `true`, the application you are testing won't be reinstalled after every test run. This might save you further time, but it won't be suitable for test setups that require the application's state to be reset between tests. Note that then cacheId is set, no device cleaning will take place in between sessions, regardless of noReset value.

>**NOTE**: Our [legacy Real Device Cloud platform](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102721177) used the capability `testobject_cache_device` – specific to static allocation – to keep the device allocated to you during the cleaning process. This capability has been deprecated and replaced with `cacheId`, which works for both static and dynamic allocation. If you have scripts that use `testobject_cache_device`, they will still work for static allocation, and the 10-second limit on cached devices is still the same.

## Monitoring Real Device Performance for Appium Tests

By including the desired capability `recordDeviceVitals` in your Appium test script, you can collect performance statistics for the real devices used in your tests, including CPU, Network, Memory, and Thread performance. This topic describes how to set up the desired capability in your tests, and collect the statistics when the test completes.

**Setting `recordDeviceVitals`**

Include this setting as part of your Appium test script capabilities:

```java
capabilities.setCapability("recordDeviceVitals", true);
```

**Collecting Performance Metrics**

1. When your test completes, log into the Real Device Testing web interface, and select the app that you used in the test from your dashboard.
2. Click **Automated Testing > Appium**.

## TestObject (Legacy RDC)

:::warning
This information applies specifically to TestObject, our [Legacy Real Device Platform](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102721177).

For APIs and authorization credentials, use the Legacy Real Device Cloud REST API (app.testobject.com) and [TestObject Data Center Endpoints](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102704068).
:::

### Uploading Using TestObject

**Creating a Real Device Project on TestObject**

When you create a project, you'll need to provide information about the website or app you want to test, and the device settings you want to use in your tests. You can also create versions of the project to reflect changes in the app or website throughout your development process.

**Versioning Real Device Projects on TestObject**

Once you've created a real device project, you can create versions of it. Each of these versions will be stored in your project, and you can run tests against the current Active version, or a previous version.
