The Sauce Labs real device cloud provides you with the ability to run either [live](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Live+Testing+for+Native+Mobile+Apps+on+Real+Devices) or automated tests across hundreds of mobile device/OS combinations, in either a private or public real device cloud.


## What You'll Need

*   Before you can upload your app and leverage real devices, ensure that you meet the project support and requirements. See [Automated Mobile App Testing Admin Guide](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Mobile+Application+Testing+Admin+Guide#mobile-test-admin-real-devices)for further details.
*   A Sauce Labs account.
*   The mobile app you wish to test. If you don't have an app and would like to try out our test functionality, feel free to download and use our[ Sauce Labs demo app](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases).


## Uploading and Accessing Your Apps on Real Devices

<TabItem value="Using a Remote Location">

**Installing Mobile Apps from a Remote Location**

There may be situations where you want to install an app from a downloadable remote location (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, a GitHub repository). The app is completely removed from the real device after the test completes, providing an added layer of security for your app.

Please review the following guidelines below before uploading your app:

1. Make sure your app meets the <a href="/mobile-apps/automated-testing/devices">requirements</a> for Android and iOS Mobile App Testing.
2. Upload your app to the hosting location.
3. Ensure Sauce Labs has READ access to the app URL.
4. In your Appium test script, enter the URL for the app as the "app" desired capability. Example Java Snippet:
```
caps.setCapability("app", "https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases/download/2.3.0/Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.2.3.0.apk?raw=true");
```

**Installing your App on Private Devices**

In some cases, you may need to upload / install your app to a private device and also prevent the device from broad internet access while under test. The steps to achieve this are:

* Upload your app to an internal git repository, or private hosting solution with the necessary permissions (e.g. Amazon S3 with a strict bucket policy).
* Ensure the hosted app URL is available to the machine running the automated test.
* Ensure that you've enabled the **Require Sauce Connect/VPN** setting in your [organization's security settings](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=69108863).

>**NOTE**: Each Session is a "Fresh" Install. You will not be able to access information about different versions of your app because each session includes a "fresh" installation of your app.

<TabItem value="Using the REST API">

**Uploading Mobile Apps with the Sauce Labs REST API**

Below are some examples of how to use the Sauce Labs REST API to upload your mobile app to our App Storage and get your real device project started. See also: [Mobile App Testing API](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=80416665).

**REST API Authentication**

For APIs and authorization credentials, use the Sauce Labs Storage REST API (app.saucelabs.com).

A recommended best practice is to set your credentials as environment variables, like so:

```SAUCE_USERNAME='valid.username'
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY='valid.key'
```

For specific instructions on how to set environment variables, visit the following links:

* [Set Environment Variables with Windows 10](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/08/31/how-to-change-environment-variables-on-windows-10/)
* [Set Environment Variables with MacOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106778/how-do-i-set-environment-variables-on-os-x)
* [Set Environment Variables with Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables)

**Supported Use Cases for Sauce Labs Real Device Testing**

* Execute Appium tests against a private real device hosted in the U.S., using your Sauce Labs username and access key
* Use Sauce Storage, for Appium testing, as you usually do for emulators and simulators tests
* Analyze Appium test executions, on Sauce Labs similar to the way you do it for desktop, emulators and simulators
* Consume Real Device Cloud (RDC) API similar to the way you do for emulators and simulators (with applicable RDC settings)

**Example Test Script**

```sh
private URL createUrl() throws MalformedURLException {
    return new URL("https://$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/wd/hub");
}

@BeforeEach
void setUp() throws MalformedURLException {
    DesiredCapabilities desiredCapabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
    desiredCapabilities.setCapability("platformName", "iOS");
    IOSDriver driver = new IOSDriver(createUrl(), desiredCapabilities);
}
```

**App Storage and Data Center Endpoints**

Below are some examples of how to use the Sauce Labs REST API to upload your mobile app to Sauce Storage. For details related to authorization credentials, see [Data Center Endpoints](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=102704068).

To connect to the real device cloud in your automated Appium tests, you'll need to use include either the EU or US storage endpoint in your test script. This example (Mac OSX / Linux) how to upload an app to App Storage in the US-West Data Center:

```sh
$ curl -F "payload=@/Users/$SAUCE_USERNAME/Downloads/$FILE_NAME.ipa" -F "name=$FILE_NAME.ipa" -u "$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"  'https://api.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/v1/storage/upload'
```

>**NOTE**: For more detailed information on how to access the app in your automated test builds and use the Storage API, see [App Storage](/mobile-apps/app-storage.md).

Below are more examples using the EU and US endpoints.

**Creating a Real Device Project on TestObject**

When you create a project, you'll need to provide information about the website or app you want to test, and the device settings you want to use in your tests. You can also create versions of the project to reflect changes in the app or website throughout your development process.

**Versioning Real Device Projects on TestObject**

Once you've created a real device project, you can create versions of it. Each of these versions will be stored in your project, and you can run tests against the current Active version, or a previous version.

**TestObject API Examples**

US Data Center:

Mac OSX / Linux

```sh
$ curl -u "$TEST_OBJECT_USERNAME:$TEST_OBJECT_API_KEY" -X POST \

## Configuring Appium Tests for Real Devices

:::note Different Behaviors from Local Appium Server Testing

Some Appium capabilities behave differently when running Appium tests in the real device cloud instead of against a local Appium server, including:

* Emulator-only capabilities will not work.
* The `app` capability is always overwritten, and points to the app file you uploaded to our system.
* The `noReset` capability only works if device caching is enabled. By default, it is set to `false`.
* Some Appium capabilities may not be supported. You can find a list [here](/mobile-apps/automated-testing/appium/real-devices.md#unsupported-appium-capabilities).

Different setups might have slightly different ways of handling capabilities and/or different requirements. You should also check the [examples for your specific setup](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Examples+of+Appium+Test+Setups+for+Real+Device+Testing) to make sure you are providing all of the required capabilities.
:::

**Setting `appiumVersion`**

If you omit the `appiumVersion` in your test configuration, your test will be running with our default Appium version. We recommend that you specify one of the newer Appium versions that provides a more extended API and fixes to known bugs.

**Checking the Appium Version for Your Test**
1. Log in to Sauce Labs.
2. Find and select the test that you ran using Appium to view the **Test Details** page.
3. Click the **Metadata** tab.
4. Look for the **Logs** row and select **Appium Log**. The first line should indicate the Appium version. For example, `2014-05-05T17:45:07.541Z - info: Welcome to Appium v1.3.6`.

**Setting Browser Name**

When testing a native mobile app, the value for `browserName` is an empty string, as in `caps.setCapability("browserName", "");`.

**Setting the Location of Your Mobile App**

If the app you want to test has been uploaded to a location other than Sauce Storage, you need to specify this location for `app`, and make sure that this location is accessible to Sauce Labs browsers. For example, `caps.setCapability("app","sauce-storage:mapp.zip");`.

**Setting `automationName` for Android Apps**

If you're testing a native mobile app against Android versions 4.0-4.1, or a hybrid mobile against Android versions 4.0 - 4.2, you need to set the capability `"automationName","selendroid"`. These Android versions are only supported via Appium’s bundled version of Selendroid, which utilizes [Instrumentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Instrumentation.html). Later versions of Android are supported via Appium’s own UiAutomator library.

### Device Caching and Cleanup

By default, each time you complete a test session, the real device cloud uninstalls your application, performs device cleaning, and de-allocates the device. This means that if you have multiple tests that you want to run on the same device, you will, by default, wait for this cleaning process to complete between every test.

However, you can use the capability `cacheId` to leave the device allocated to you for 10 seconds after each test completes. If you immediately start another test on the device, you won't need to wait for the allocation and device cleaning process to be repeated. In this case, no device cleaning will take place in between sessions, with the only exception being the application under test and the data it owns.

>**NOTE**: TestObject, our Legacy Real Device Cloud platform used the capability `testobject_cache_device` to keep the device allocated to you during the cleaning process, but you could only use this capability for static allocation. This has been deprecated and replaced with the capability `cacheId`, described in this section, which works for both static and dynamic allocation. If you have scripts that use `testobject_cache_device`, they will still work for static allocation only if you're using TestObject. The 10-second limit on cached devices is still the same.

## Test Script Examples

These Appium script examples (in Python) can help streamline your real device testing process. They use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) test framework. Feel free to [clone these scripts directly from GitHub](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-python/tree/master/appium-examples/pytest), and follow the instructions in the [README file](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-python).

## Best Practices and Reporting Test Results

Now that you've been able to get a test running on Sauce, there are a few other modifications you can make to your tests. These example scripts show how to:

*   Implement timeouts to control text execution times
*   Add annotations
*   Send Pass/Fail results to Sauce Labs
*   [Use Build IDs and tags to differentiate and identify test runs](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Build+IDs%2C+Tags%2C+and+Names+to+Identify+Your+Tests)

You can find more information under [Best Practices for Running Tests](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Best+Practices+for+Running+Tests) and [Setting Test Status to Pass or Fail](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Setting+Test+Status+to+Pass+or+Fail).

Features specific to our real device cloud include:

*   Support for multiple frameworks (i.e., Appium, Robotium, Espresso, and XCUITest)
*   [IPSec VPN secure connections to private clouds](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/IPSec+VPN)
*   Devices cleaning process between sessions to ensure maximum privacy
*   Carrier Network Connectivity (devices with SIM cards)

As a reminder – from the [Sauce Labs](http://app.saucelabs.com/) platform, you'll have access both our virtual device cloud (emulators, simulators) and real device cloud. This allows you to use the same features – APIs, endpoints, reporting, secure tunnels, analytics, and more – for both clouds.


## Monitoring Real Device Performance for Appium Tests

By including the desired capability `recordDeviceVitals` in your Appium test script, you can collect performance statistics for the real devices used in your tests, including CPU, Network, Memory, and Thread performance. This topic describes how to set up the desired capability in your tests, and collect the statistics when the test completes.


**Setting `recordDeviceVitals`**

Include this setting as part of the desired capabilities in your Appium test script:

```
capabilities.setCapability("recordDeviceVitals", true);
```

**Collecting Performance Metrics**

1. When your test completes, log into the Real Device Testing web interface, and select the app that you used in the test from your dashboard.
2. Click **Automated Testing > Appium**.
3. Select the **Test Results** for your test.
4. Under **Mobile Vitals**, click the link to download the CSV file containing your test performance metrics.
