Sauce Labs uses its framework agnostic test orchestrator [`saucectl`](/testrunner-toolkit) to execute Espresso and XCUITest tests based on one or more configuration files that instruct `saucectl` to run your tests exactly the way you specify. Results get published in your Sauce Labs account, where you can compare 30 days of results across different environments and frameworks all in one view.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account ([Log in](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) or sign up for a [free trial license](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)).
* Your Sauce Labs [Username and Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).
* Your Espresso or XCUITest apps and files.

## Installation & Setup

`saucectl` can execute both Espresso and XCUITest tests, so the set up steps are the same regardless of which framework you are using.

### 1. Install `saucectl`

Begin by installing the `saucectl` CLI so it has access to your local project.

```bash
sudo sh -c 'curl -L https://saucelabs.github.io/saucectl/install | bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin'
```

:::caution Required Minimum Versions
Espresso requires `saucectl` version 0.36.0 or later and XCUITest requires `saucectl` version 0.44.0 or later.
:::

### 2. Check out the demo repositories

Clone or download the [Espresso](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-espresso-example) and/or [XCUITest](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-xcuitest-example) example repos, as applicable to your project, to obtain the `saucectl` directory structure and example files for use as templates.

### 3. Link your Sauce Labs account

1. Generate a credentials file that `saucectl` can reference to authenticate your CLI commands.      
    ```
    saucectl configure
    ```
1. Enter your Sauce Labs `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` at the prompts.
1. `saucectl` creates a `credentials.yml` file in a `.sauce` folder of your home directory.

:::tip Use Environment Variables
You can set your Sauce Labs credentials as [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables) instead of generating a `credentials.yml`, if you prefer. In systems where both sets of credentials exist, environment variable values are prioritized.
:::


## Configuration

Each demo repo includes a sample `config.yml` file (in the `<root>/.sauce` directory) that is preconfigured to run the example test, which is also included in the repo.

Modify the `config.yml` file to run your existing tests.

* **TestObject Migration:** refer to the [Commands Map](#legacy-to-saucectl-commands-map) to determine which CLI commands and/or YAML configuration properties to use based on your TestObject configurations.
* **New Accounts:** see the `saucectl` configuration documentation for [Espresso](/testrunner-toolkit/configuration/espresso) and [XCUITest](/testrunner-toolkit/configuration/xcuitest).

For Android tests, if your emulator session fails to start, make sure the app you are targeting is an `\*.apk`, not an `\*.aab`, as the latter is not yet supported in emulator tests.


:::tip Alternative Config Files
You can create multiple configuration files to support different frameworks or different test setups and then reference the applicable configuration file at runtime using the CLI command:

```
saucectl run -c ./path/to/<configFile>.yml
```

### TestObject (Legacy RDC) to `saucectl` Commands Map

<p><span className="sauceGold">DEPRECATED</span></p>

:::warning TestObject End-of-life
TestObject was discontinued on September 1, 2021. If you have any questions, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager or Sauce Labs Support.
:::

`saucectl` configures and runs your Espresso and XCUITest tests entirely from the CLI and YAML configuration settings. The following tables provide a list of testing actions, mapping the TestObject configuration settings to the equivalent settings in `saucectl`. Both TestObject and Sauce Labs utilize CLI commands and YAML configuration files to define the many ways in which you can run your tests. Some actions can be set using either a CLI command _or_ a YAML property, while other actions can only be configured by one or the other, so the maps below are separated by CLI commands and YAML properties for ease of navigation.

:::important
Real Device testing on Sauce Labs is data center contingent, so you will only have access to the public and private devices available within the data center specified for the test, rather than the entire body of devices across all data centers. Each data center includes a very similar  variety of devices and operating systems to provide a broad selection for testing, but depending on your organizationâ€™s concurrency allowances, this separation may affect the number of tests you can run in parallel.
