With Virtual Devices on Sauce Labs, you can test your mobile applications on a variety of Android emulators and iOS simulators. If you do not have an app, consider using the Sauce Labs [Swag Labs](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile) sample app for validating your account functionality as well as your tests. 

## What You'll Need
* A Sauce Labs Account
* A Mobile Application to Test

### Starting a Live Session on Real Devices

You must select a device prior to launching a session. By default, the public devices will display in a grid format like so:

There is a distinction between __Public Devices__ and __Private Devices__.

* Public devices are accessible by anyone with a Sauce Labs Account and are subject to availability. If a device is in use, you will see a yellow "Busy" flag across the device thumbnail.
* Private devices are associated with your account and are an enterprise only feature.

### Launching a Real Device

Hover over a device thumbnail and click on __Details__ to see the specs for that device. Once you find the desired device, select __Launch__.
