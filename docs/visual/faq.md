## General


#### Can I revert a recently accepted snapshot?
Yes - after accepting a snapshot, you can revert its acceptance before running another build by clicking on the Accepted status dropdown in the State Detail page, and selecting **Revert**.<br/>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/visual/revertAccepted.png')} alt="Revert accepted screenshot" width="150" />


#### How do I show lazy-loaded content in my screenshot?

You need to trigger the lazy-loaded content so that it loads and displays in your web page. How to do this depends on how the lazy-loaded content is triggered to load.

For example, if content is loaded based on scrolling down to a particular section of your web page, then you will need to scroll to that section using JavaScript:

```js
window.scroll(0, 1000);
```


#### Why is my screenshot not full-page?
Screener captures a full-page screenshot by default in all browsers. But the height of the full-page screenshot is based on the scrollable height of the main document body.

If the body is not scrollable, then the screenshot captured will appear to be cut off. For example, if the "overflow" style on the body is set to "hidden", then the body cannot be scrolled.


##### Are there workarounds?
Yes, but the workaround depends on how the website CSS was built and understanding what is causing the body to not be scrollable.

If the overflow style on the body is "hidden", then the client could execute the following JS in an Execute Script command in the test to set body overflow to `'auto'` before capturing a snapshot:

```js
document.body.style.overflow = 'auto'
```

#### Does Screener capture iframes?
Yes it is a feature in beta for our E2E product. Look for [`iframes` and `iframesOptions`](/visual/e2e-testing/commands-options).




## Visual E2E

#### What Sauce Labs browsers are supported by Visual E2E?
Visual E2E is unified with Sauce VMs, and uses Sauce browsers exclusively.


#### How do I test smaller mobile web viewport sizes for responsive design testing?
This can be done by setting [`viewportSize` in your `sauce:visual` capabilities](/visual/e2e-testing/commands-options/#saucevisual-capability-options).


#### How do I run functional tests only after integrating Visual E2E?
If you want to run their functional tests only, you do not need to modify any of your visual integration code. Just change your WebDriver endpoint from `hub.screener.io` to `ondemand.saucelabs.com`.




## Component Testing and Screener E2E (Legacy)

#### What Storybook versions are supported?
screener-storybook supports Storybook version 3 to 6.x (latest).


#### Why is Screener not picking up data from my CI build?
For screener-storybook and screener-runner tests run within a CI tool, Screener will automatically set build, branch, and commit options if you are using one of the following CI tools:

* Jenkins
* CircleCI
* Travis CI
* Visual Studio Team Services
* Codeship
* GitLab CI
* Drone
* Bitbucket Pipelines
* Semaphore
* Buildkite

This works by pulling data from environment variables in the CI job.
<details><summary>Click here to see expected Environment variables</summary>

```js reference title="Screener Runner"
https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner/blob/master/src/ci.js
```

</details>

As an example, Jenkins looks for the following environment variables: `JENKINS_URL` or `JENKINS_HOME`, and `BUILD NUMBER`:
```js reference title="Screener Runner"
https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner/blob/master/src/ci.js#L23
```

CircleCI looks for the following environment variables: `CI`, `CIRCLECI`, `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`:
```js reference title="Screener Runner"
https://github.com/screener-io/screener-runner/blob/master/src/ci.js#L31
```

If these environment variables are NOT accessible in the build, the reason is most likely that the CI is running the test job inside a separate container, and the variables need to be passed into the container.


#### How do I add Screener Steps to Storybook project that uses React Hooks?
React Hooks messes up using the Screener component because it executes its magic at runtime. So to use Screener Steps with React Hooks, you need to use Storybook Decorators to wrap the component story. Here is an example script: [Storybook + Screener Steps with Hooks](https://gist.github.com/screener-io/ada0e3c51137c907ba80728ad7fab23b).


#### Does Sauce Visual interact with knobs within stories in Storybook and test as needed?
Screener-storybook does not automatically interact with knobs, as there would be potentially an infinite number of permutations. but if there's a UI state that the user wants to get to using knobs, then this is possible with Screener Steps.

In the Storybook knobs add-on, there's a knobs UI where the user can copy a query string for the knobs configuration. They can copy this querystring, and use it with Screener Steps `executeScript` method to reproduce those knobs values.

Click on the copy button in the lower right, then paste into an editor, then copy only the query-string portion (after the `?`) and paste that into a Screener step.

```js title="Example"
<Screener steps={new Steps()
  .executeScript('window.location.href = "?path=/story/button&knob-Label=works"')
  .snapshot('Knobs')
  .end()
}>
```

#### How do I resolve error `Error: Storybook object not found`?

1. Run test with `--debug` flag enabled. For example: `npm run test-storybook -- --debug`.
2. After running with debug flag, reach out to Sauce Labs Support Team and provide them with your log output.

If the following logs are found, it means that Puppeteer could not be launched because of missing dependencies:

```
Error: Failed to launch chrome!
/node-packages/kanan_ui/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/linux-662092/chrome-linux/chrome: error while loading shared libraries: libX11-xcb.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

The [Troubleshooting docs for Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) have a lot of info on how to resolve this for various environments, such as TravisCI and CircleCI.

Here is an article on how to setup Puppeteer in GitLab: [How to setup Chrome Headless on GitLab CI with Puppeteer & Docker](https://ali-dev.medium.com/how-to-setup-chrome-headless-on-gitlab-ci-with-puppeteer-docker-fbb562cbaee1). The article suggests installing all dependencies with the following command:

```bash
apt-get install gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0–0 libc6 \
libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1–3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 \
libgcc1 libgconf-2–4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0–0 libglib2.0–0 libgtk-3–0 \
libnspr4 libpango-1.0–0 libpangocairo-1.0–0 libstdc++6 libx11–6 \
libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 \
libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 \
libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 \
libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget -y
```
