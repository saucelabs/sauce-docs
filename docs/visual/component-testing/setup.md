>**Screener Docs are Now Sauce Docs**<br/>
As part of our efforts to bring you a single, unified documentation site, we've migrated all Visual Docs from [Screener.io](https://screener.io) to Sauce Docs.

Follow the steps to integrate Sauce Labs Visual Component Testing with Storybook, a UI component development tool. The integration will run your existing Storybook stories as UI regression test cases in our automated visual testing platform.
* Get detailed UI test results across your React, Vue, Angular, and HTML components
* Facilitate accelerate debugging and shorten release cycles

:::caution New to Storybook?
Follow Storybook installation instructions under [step 1](#confirm-screener-installation).
:::

## What You'll Need
* A [Sauce Labs self-serve or enterprise account](https://saucelabs.com/pricing) with access to Visual Testing. To request access, contact your CSM or Sauce Labs Support. Not available for free-trial accounts.
* Your Sauce Labs [Username and Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).
* Your [Screener API Key](https://screener.io/v2/account/api-key).
* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
* Have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org).
* Recommended: an existing [Storybook project](https://storybook.js.org/basics/quick-start-guide/) with some [component stories](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories/) written.



## Confirm Screener Installation

1. First, confirm that Storybook is installed correctly on your local machine by running `npm run storybook`.

  <details><summary>New to Storybook? <strong>Click here</strong> to install.</summary>

  Follow the steps below to install Storybook and create your first project. Open a terminal and run the following commands, one at a time.

  ```bash title="Installs Storybook and Creates Storybook Project Called 'my-storybook'"
  npx create-react-app my-storybook
  ```

  ```bash title="Navigates to Storybook Project"
  cd my-storybook
  ```

  ```bash title="Initializes Storybook"
  npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
  ```

  ```bash title="Launches Your Storybook Project"
  npm run storybook
  ```
  </details>


## Install Screener Package

2. From your terminal, navigate to the file path where you downloaded your Storybook sample project (i.e., `cd my-storybook`).
3. Install the [screener-storybook package](https://github.com/screener-io/screener-storybook) as a dependency in your project:
  ```bash
  npm install screener-storybook --save-dev
  ```

## Set Environment Variables

4. In your terminal, set your Screener API key as an environment variable:
  <details><summary>What is this?</summary>

  :::warning PROTECT YOUR CREDENTIALS
  To protect your authentication data from exposure, the example code in this Quickstart requires you to set your Sauce Labs credentials as [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables). We recommend doing this for all Sauce Labs automated tests.

   <Tabs
        defaultValue="Mac/Linux"
        values={[
          {label: 'Mac/Linux', value: 'Mac/Linux'},
          {label: 'Windows Powershell', value: 'Windows Powershell'},
        ]}>

   <TabItem value="Mac/Linux">

   ```bash
   export SCREENER_API_KEY="REPLACE WITH SCREENER API KEY"
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Windows Powershell">

   ```bash
   $Env:SCREENER_API_KEY = "REPLACE WITH SCREENER API KEY"
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>


## Create Screener Config File

5. Create a new JavaScript file, name it **screener.config.js**, and save it to the root folder of your Storybook project.
6. Choose one of the options below:

  <details><summary>If you're using the sample Storybook project, <strong>click here</strong>.</summary>

  copy and paste this code snippet into your **screener.config.js** file, then save it.
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     projectRepo: 'sb-6.1-test',
     storybookConfigDir: '.storybook',
     apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
     resolution: '1024x768'
   };
   ```
  </details>

  <details><summary>If you're using your own Storybook project, <strong>click here</strong>.</summary>

  Copy and paste this code snippet into your **screener.config.js** file, then replace the placeholder values with your own.

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     projectRepo: '<your-repo>',
     storybookConfigDir: '<directory>',
     storybookStaticDir: '<directory>',
     apiKey: process.env.SCREENER_API_KEY,
     resolution: '<resolution>'
   };
  ```

   `projectRepo` the name of your project's repository (e.g., GitHub repos are in the "owner/repository-name" format).<br/>
   `resolution` is your desired browser resolution. <br/>
   `storybookConfigDir`/ `storybookStaticDir` are your Storybook server options; you may not need to add both. In your project directory, find the `start-storybook` command, usually a script in **package.json** file. If the `-c` or `--config-dir` option is set, add `storybookConfigDir` and that value to your code snippet. If the `-s` or `--static-dir` option is set, add the `storybookStaticDir` with its value.
  </details>

## Add Screener Script

7. Open your project's **package.json** file and add the following npm script to your `"scripts": {` section:
   ```json
   "test-storybook": "screener-storybook --conf screener.config.js"  
   ```

## Run Test

8. Run your test:
  ```bash
  npm run test-storybook
  ```

## View Results

9. Log in to Visual Testing Dashboard (Sauce Labs > **SAUCE APPS** > **Visual** > **Login**) to view your running test in progress. This initial test will be labeled as failed because there's no preexisting baseline state to compare against. To resolve this, [review and accept](https://screener.io/v2/docs/visual-e2e/review-flow) the new states as the baseline.

  For each build, you should receive an [email summary](/visual/notifications/) indicating the pass/fail status, delivered to the address associated with your Sauce Labs account.
