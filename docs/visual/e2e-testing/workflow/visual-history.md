Screener provides the ability to view the recent visual history of each UI state, as well as who reviewed and whether they accepted or rejected the state.

This is useful for:

* Seeing how a UI state has changed over time.
* Knowing ***who*** reviewed previously, and ***what*** was accepted or rejected.

The visual history can be viewed by opening the side panel in a UI state, and selecting the **History** tab.
