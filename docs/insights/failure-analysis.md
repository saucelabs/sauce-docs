Failure Analysis gives you insight into where you can immediately improve your test execution on Sauce Labs. With a single dashboard view within the Sauce UI, Failure Analysis uses machine learning to view pass/fail data and Selenium and Appium command logs to unearth common failures, and how they are affecting the test suite as a whole. It then presents a report with tabs that aggregate patterns that are indicative of failure.
