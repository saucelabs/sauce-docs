The Sauce Labs **Insights** section allows you to view your test data from a variety of different perspectives to ensure that you can see both the big picture of your testing effectiveness and the individual slices of test data that help you pinpoint failure causes and fix them.

:::tip
Sauce Labs has also published an [Insights API](/dev/api/insights) so you can build a custom dashboard with views that are specific to your test strategy.

## Touring the Interface

Access the **Insights** menu from the left-side navigation menu of our web app. From here, you have access to the six primary views of your test data.

| Job Overview     | Shows a variety of views of the data related to all the tests executed that match the specified filter criteria broken into two focus tabs. <br/>The **Overview** tab shows test case health snapshot, test summary, and test breakdowns (browser, OS, Frameworks, Devices) and you can filter for **Virtual Cloud** (VDC) or **Real Devices** (RDC). <br/>The **Errors** tab shows the total number of errors across the execution of all tests in the filter for either **Virtual Cloud** or **Real Devices**, along with a graph depicting the error rate over time. Below, there is a breakdown of each error with the number of times it occurred in the period, and you can click any of them to see the list of tests in which it occurred. |
| Job History      | Shows a visual snapshot of the results for a specific test over time. See the [Test History](/insights/history) page for specific views and capabilities descriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Using Filters to Adjust the Scope of Your Data

At the top of each page in the **Insights** interface is a set of properties by which you can filter the data shown on that page. As you specify values for each property, the setting is shown below the filters bar and the data on the page refreshes to reflect the applied filters.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/insights/ins-filters.png')} alt="Applied Filters" width="750"/>

The following table describes each of the filters available for customizing your test insights data.

| Filter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If you do not see the data you expect in that duration, consider whether the test was executed in a different time zone. |

Check out the individual sections of the Insights feature documentation for use cases illustrating how filtering your data view can help you pinpoint errors or inefficiencies in your tests so you can be confident that your app is functioning optimally.
