You can capture screenshots of `<frame>` and `<iframe>` elements as well. To do this, simply switch to the desired frame before taking the screenshot.

The screenshot will include only the content within the selected frame.
Any captured DOM elements, ignored regions or clip elements must be specified within the current frame.

:::note
Frames support is available only for full page screenshots on desktop.
