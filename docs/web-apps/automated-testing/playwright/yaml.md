`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your Playwright tests, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running Playwright tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/ide/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::


## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-playwright-example/blob/master/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running Playwright tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```
---

## `kind`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: playwright
```
---

## `showConsoleLog`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Generates the `console.log` as local output and as a test asset in Sauce Labs for all tests. By default, `console.log` is only included in results for failed tests.

```yaml
showConsoleLog: true
```
---

## `defaults`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any default settings for the project.

```yaml
defaults:
  mode: sauce
  timeout: 15m
```
---

### `mode`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Instructs `saucectl` run tests remotely through Sauce Labs (`sauce`) or locally on `docker`. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `mode` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `sauce`.

```yaml
  mode: sauce
```
---

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long (in `ms`, `s`, `m`, or `h`) `saucectl` should wait for each suite to complete. You can override this setting for individual suites using the `timeout` setting within the [`suites`](#suites) object. If not set, the default value is `0` (unlimited).

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

## `sauce`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    name: Testing Playwright Support
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  concurrency: 10
```
---

### `region`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

```yaml
  region: eu-central-1
```
---

### `metadata`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps you distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: Testing Playwright Support
  build: RC 10.4.a
  tags:
    - e2e
    - release team
    - beta
    - featurex
```
---

### `concurrency`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the maximum number of suites to execute at the same time. If the test defines more suites than the max, excess suites are queued and run in order as each suite completes.

:::caution
For tests running on Sauce, set this value to equal or less than your Sauce concurrency allowance, as setting a higher value may result in jobs dropped by the server.
:::

```yaml
  concurrency: 5
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the concurrency flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --ccy 5
```
---

### `retries`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of times to retry a failed suite.

```yaml
  retries: 1
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the retries flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --retries 1
```
---

### `tunnel`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels/) to establish a secure connection with Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the name and owner (if applicable) in this property.

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```
---

#### `name`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies an active Sauce Connect tunnel to use for secure connectivity to the Sauce Labs cloud.

:::note
This property replaces the former `id` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
```
---

#### `owner`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the Sauce Labs user who created the specified tunnel, which is required if the user running the tests did not create the tunnel.

:::note
This property replaces the former `parent` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```
---

## `env`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

  image: saucelabs/stt-playwright-node:vX.X.X
```
---

### `fileTransfer`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Method in which to transfer test files into the docker container. Valid values are:
* `mount`: (Default) Mounts files and folders into the docker container. Changes to these files and folders will be reflected on the host (and vice a versa).
* `copy`: Copies files and folders into the docker container. If you run into permission issues, either due to docker or host settings, `copy` is the advised use case. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) for more about the copy convention.

```yaml
  fileTransfer: copy
```
---

### `image`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies which docker image and version to use when running tests. Valid values are in the format:
`saucelabs/<framework-node>:<vX.X.X>`. See [Supported Testing Platforms](/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright#supported-testing-platforms) for Docker release notes related to Playwright.

```yaml
  image: saucelabs/< stt-playwright-mocha-node | stt-playwright-node | stt-testcafe-node >:< vX.X.X >
```

:::caution
Avoid using the `latest` tag for docker images, as advised in [this article](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/#:~:text=You%20should%20avoid%20using%20the,apart%20from%20the%20image%20ID.).
:::
---

## `rootDir`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

See [Tailoring Your Test File Bundle](#tailoring-your-test-file-bundle) for more details. The following examples show the different relative options for setting this value.

```yaml
  rootDir: "./" # Use the current directory
```

```yaml
  rootDir: "packages/subpackage" # Some other package from within a monorepo
```

:::caution
Only the files contained within `rootDir` will be available during the tests. Any reference to a file that is not included in `rootDir` will make the tests fail.
:::

---

## `npm`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

:::
---

### `configFile`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

```yaml
  configFile: config.ts
```
---

## `suites`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties providing details about the test suites to run. May contain multiple suite definitions. See the full [example config](#example-configuration) for an illustration of multiple suite definitions.

---

### `name`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

The name of the test suite, which will be reflected in the results and related artifacts.

```yaml
  - name: "saucy test"
```
---

### `env`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that may be referenced in the tests for this suite. Expanded environment variables are supported. Values set here will be overwritten by values set in the global `env` property.

```yaml

```
---

### `screenResolution`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING | <span class="highlight sauce-cloud">Sauce Cloud only</span> |</small></p>

Specifies a browser window screen resolution, which may be useful if you are attempting to simulate a browser on a particular device type. See [Test Configurations](/basics/test-config-annotation/test-config) for a list of available resolution values.

```yaml
    screenResolution: "1920x1080"
```
---

### `mode`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies whether the individual suite will run on `docker` or `sauce`, potentially overriding the default project mode setting.

```yaml
  mode: "sauce"
```
---

### `testMatch`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

One or more paths to the playwright test files to run for this suite. Regex values are supported to indicate all files of a certain type or in a certain directory, etc. If your tests are in TypeScript, you must [transpile them to JavaScript](#transpiling-typescript-tests).

```yaml
    testMatch: ["**/*.js"]
```
---

### `excludedTestFiles`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ARRAY |</small></p>

Excludes test files to skip the tests. You can use regex values to indicate all files that match a specific value, such as a file name, type, or directory.

```yaml
    excludedTestFiles: ["**/*.js"]
```
---

### `numShards`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER | <span class="highlight playwright">Playwright version >= 1.12</span> |</small></p>

Sets the number of separate shards to create for the test suite. Read more about shard tests on the [Playwright developer site](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel#shards).

When sharding is configured, `saucectl` automatically creates the sharded jobs based on the number of shards you specify. For example, for a suite that specifies 2 shards, `saucectl` clones the suite and runs shard `1/2` on the first suite, and the other shard `2/2` on the identical clone suite.

:::caution Shard Property Exclusivity
The `numShards` and `shard` properties are mutually exclusive within each suite. If you have values for both in a single suite, the test will fail and terminate. You can, however, vary shard settings across different suites.
:::

```yaml
  numShards: 2
```
---

### `shard`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

When sharding is configured, saucectl automatically splits the tests (e.g., by spec or concurrency) so that they can easily run in parallel.
For sharding by concurrency, saucectl splits test files into several groups (the number of groups is determined by the concurrency setting). Each group will then run as an individual job.

Selectable values: `spec` to shard by spec file, `concurrency` to shard by concurrency. Remove this field or leave it empty `""` for no sharding.

:::caution Shard Property Exclusivity
The `numShards` and `shard` properties are mutually exclusive within each suite. If you have values for both in a single suite, the test will fail and terminate. You can, however, vary shard settings across different suites.
:::

```yaml
    shard: spec
```

---

### `params`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A parent property that details any additional parameters you wish to set for the test suite.

```yaml

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Determines whether to run the test suite in [headless](/headless) mode.

```yaml
    headless: true
```
---

#### `sloMo`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Allows you to alter the test execution speed for the test suite in milliseconds, to simulate different network connectivity or other conditions that may impact load times.

    project: "project name"
```
---

#### `grep`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Patterns to run tests based on their title.

```yaml
    grep: "should include"
```
---

#### `grepInvert`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Patterns to skip tests based on their title.

```yaml
    grepInvert: "should exclude"
```
---

### `timeout`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, potentially overriding the default project timeout setting.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
  timeout: 15m
```
---

### `preExec`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

Specifies which commands needs to be executed before the tests are actually started. The commands are executed from the root directory of your project.

:::note
There is a 300-second limit for all `preExec` commands to complete.

  preExec:
    - node ./scripts/pre-execution-script.js
```
---

### `timeZone`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Allows you to set a custom time zone for your test based on a city name. Most major cities are supported.
