`saucectl` relies on a YAML specification file to determine exactly which tests to run and how to run them. To customize `saucectl` to run your Cucumber.js tests with Playwright, simply modify the properties of the YAML file accordingly. This page defines each of the configuration properties specific to running Cucumber.js with Playwright tests.

## Setting an Alternative Configuration File

By default, `saucectl` looks for the `config.yml` file in the `.sauce` folder of your project root, but you can actually specify a different file, or if you are using multiple frameworks or need to configure different sets of tests to run separately, you may choose to have multiple configuration files that you can direct `saucectl` to reference as necessary.

Use the following configuration at runtime to direct `saucectl` to use any configuration file you choose:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/{config-file}.yml
```

:::note YAML Required
While you can use multiple files of different names or locations to specify your configurations, each file must be a `*.yml` and follow the `saucectl` syntax. Our IDE Integrations (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/ide/vscode)) can help you out by validating the YAML files and provide handy suggestions, so make sure to check them out!
:::

## Example Configuration

```yaml reference
https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-playwright-example/blob/main/examples/cucumber/.sauce/config.yml
```

Each of the properties supported for running Cucumber.js with Playwright tests through `saucectl` is defined below.

## `apiVersion`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the version of the underlying configuration schema. At this time, `v1alpha` is the only supported value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
```

---

## `kind`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies which framework is associated with the automation tests configured in this specification.

```yaml
kind: playwright-cucumberjs
```

---

## `showConsoleLog`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

Controls whether the contents of `console.log` are always shown in the local output of saucectl. By default (false), `console.log` is only shown for failed suites.

```yaml
showConsoleLog: true
```

---

## `defaults`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any default settings for the project.

```yaml
defaults:
  timeout: 15m
```

---

### `timeout`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, overriding the default project timeout setting of 30 minutes.

When the suite reaches the timeout limit, its status is set to '?' in the CLI. This does not reflect the actual status of the job in the Sauce Labs web UI or API.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
defaults:
  timeout: 15m
```

---

## `sauce`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The parent property containing all settings related to how tests are run and identified in the Sauce Labs platform.

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
  metadata:
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  concurrency: 10
```

---

### `region`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ENUM |</small></p>

Specifies through which Sauce Labs data center tests will run. Valid values are: `us-west-1` or `eu-central-1`.

:::note
If you do not specify a region in your config file, you must set it when running your command with the `--region` flag.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  region: eu-central-1
```

---

### `metadata`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties that allows you to provide additional information about your project that helps you distinguish it in the various environments in which it is used and reviewed, and also helps you apply filters to easily isolate tests based on metrics that are meaningful to you, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
sauce:
  metadata:
    build: RC 10.4.a
    tags:
      - e2e
      - release team
      - beta
      - featurex
```

---

### `concurrency`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the maximum number of suites to execute at the same time. If the test defines more suites than the max, excess suites are queued and run in order as each suite completes.

:::caution
For tests running on Sauce, set this value to equal or less than your Sauce concurrency allowance, as setting a higher value may result in jobs dropped by the server.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  concurrency: 5
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the concurrency flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --ccy 5
```

---

### `retries`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Sets the number of times to retry a failed suite. For more settings, you can refer to [passThreshold](#passThreshold).

```yaml
sauce:
  retries: 1
```

Alternatively, you can override the file setting at runtime by setting the retries flag as an inline parameter of the `saucectl run` command:

```bash
saucectl run --retries 1
```

---

### `tunnel`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

`saucectl` supports using [Sauce Connect](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels/) to establish a secure connection with Sauce Labs. To do so, launch a tunnel; then provide the name and owner (if applicable) in this property.

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

:::caution
[Only certain HTTP(S) ports](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/advanced/specifications/#supported-browsers-and-ports) are proxied by the tunnel.
:::

---

#### `name`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies an active Sauce Connect tunnel to use for secure connectivity to the Sauce Labs cloud.

:::note
This property replaces the former `id` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
```

---

#### `owner`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Identifies the Sauce Labs user who created the specified tunnel, which is required if the user running the tests did not create the tunnel.

:::note
This property replaces the former `parent` property, which is deprecated.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    owner: tunnel_owner_username
```

---

#### `timeout`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

How long to wait for the specified tunnel to be ready. Supports duration values like '10s', '30m' etc. (default: 30s)

```yaml
sauce:
  tunnel:
    name: your_tunnel_name
    timeout: 30s
```

---

### `visibility`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Sets the visibility level of test results for suites run on Sauce Labs. If unspecified or empty, `team` visibility will be applied. Valid values are:

- `public`: Accessible to everyone.
- `public restricted`: Share your job's results page and video, but keeps the logs only for you.
- `share`: Only accessible to people with a valid link.
- `team`: (Default) Only accessible to people under the same root account as you.
- `private`: Only you (the owner) will be able to view assets and test results page.

```yaml
sauce:
  visibility: private
```

---

### `launchOrder`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies the execution order for your test suites. When set to `fail rate`, test suites with the highest failure rate will execute first. If unspecified, test suites will execute in the order in which they are written in the configuration file.

```yaml
sauce:
  launchOrder: fail rate
```

---

## `env`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that are global for all tests suites in this configuration. Values set in this global property will overwrite values set for the same environment variables set at the suite level.

```yaml
env:
  hello: world
  my_var: $MY_VAR # You can also pass through existing environment variables through parameter expansion
```

:::note
Environment variables set with the saucectl `--env` flag will overwrite those specified in the sauce config file.

The order of precedence is as follows: --env flag > root-level environment variables > suite-level environment variables.
:::

---

## `rootDir`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The directory of files that need to be bundled and uploaded for the tests to run. Ignores what is specified in `.sauceignore`. See [Tailoring Your Test File Bundle](#tailoring-your-test-file-bundle) for more details. The following examples show the different relative options for setting this value.

```yaml
rootDir: "./" # Use the current directory
```

```yaml
rootDir: "packages/subpackage" # Some other package from within a monorepo
```

:::caution
Only the files contained within `rootDir` will be available during the tests. Any reference to a file that is not included in `rootDir` will make the tests fail.
:::

---

## `npm`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

```yaml
npm:
  registry: https://registry.npmjs.org
```

---

### `registries`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ARRAY |</small></p>

Specifies the location of the npm registry, scope, and credentials. Only one scopeless registry is allowed. If the registry is inside a private network, you must establish a tunnel using [Sauce Connect](/dev/cli/saucectl/#run-tests-on-sauce-labs-with-sauce-connect).

```yaml

---

### `dependencies`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | ARRAY |</small></p>

Specifies any npm packages that are required to run tests and should, therefore, be included in the bundle.
The dependencies specified here have to be already installed in the local `node_modules` folder. These dependencies, along with any related transitive dependencies, are then included in the bundle that is uploaded to Sauce Labs.

In order to run Cucumber.js tests with Playwright, you must to install the following required packages locally, and then add the dependencies to the configuration file.

```yaml
npm:
  dependencies:
    - "@cucumber/cucumber" # Cucumber official suggested package
    - "@saucelabs/cucumber-reporter" # Sauce Labs report plugin. Generates a test cases report for display on the Sauce Labs UI.
    - "typescript" # TypeScript support
    - "ts-node" # TypeScript support
```

To use this feature, make sure that `node_modules` is not ignored via `.sauceignore`.

:::note
`saucectl` doesn't support running Cucumber.js tests with Playwright via installing Cucumber related packages on the fly.
:::

---

### `packages`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies any npm packages that are required to run tests and should, therefore, be installed on the Sauce Labs VM. See [Including Node Dependencies](advanced.md#including-node-dependencies).

```yaml
artifacts:
  cleanup: true
```

---

### `retain`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Define directories to archive and retain as a test asset at the end of a test run. Archived test assets can
be downloaded automatically using the `download` configuration, via the 
[REST API](/dev/api/jobs/#get-a-job-asset-file), or through the test details page.

    - junit.xml
    - "*.log"
```

---

#### `directory`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies the path to the folder location in which to download artifacts. A separate subdirectory is generated in this location for each suite for which artifacts are downloaded. The name of the subdirectory will match the suite name. If a directory with the same name already exists, the new one will be suffixed by a serial number.

```yaml
artifacts:
  cleanup: true
  download:
    directory: ./artifacts/
```

---

#### `allAttempts`

```yaml
playwright:
  version: 1.39.0
```

:::tip
You can also define a path to your `package.json`. This will make `saucectl` use the same Playwright version that's defined in your projects `devDependencies` or `dependencies` map.

The path to your `package.json` file will be relative to the `rootDir` of your configuration.
:::

---

## `suites`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | OBJECT |</small></p>

The set of properties providing details about the test suites to run. May contain multiple suite definitions. See the full [example config](#example-configuration) for an illustration of multiple suite definitions.

---

### `name`

<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

The name of the test suite, which will be reflected in the results and related artifacts.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
```

### `browserName`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Sets the browser name for the test suite. `saucectl` passes `browserName` as the
environment variable `$BROWSER_NAME`.

The user is responsible for launching the correct browser via Cucumber.js.
Using a different browser, than specified, results in mismatched job metadata.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    browserName: "chromium"
```

---

### `env`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

A property containing one or more environment variables that may be referenced in the tests for this suite. Expanded environment variables are supported. Values set here will be overwritten by values set in the global `env` property.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    env:
      hello: world
      my_var: $MY_VAR
```

---

### `platformName`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    platformName: "Windows 11"
```

---

### `screenResolution`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Specifies a browser window screen resolution, which may be useful if you are attempting to simulate a browser on a particular device type. See [Test Configurations](/basics/test-config-annotation/test-config) for a list of available resolution values.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    screenResolution: "1920x1080"
```

---

### `shard`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

When sharding is enabled, `saucectl` automatically distributes the tests to run in parallel.

Selectable options:
- `spec`: Shards by spec file. `saucectl` starts a separate job for each spec file.
- `concurrency`: Shards by concurrency level. `saucectl` divides test files into multiple groups based on the specified concurrency setting. Each group runs as an individual job.
- `scenario`: Shards by scenario name. `saucectl` gathers scenario names from the test files and starts a job for each scenario name. Scenarios with the same name are grouped into a single job.

To disable sharding, either remove this field or set it to `""`.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: 'I am sharded'
    shard: spec
```

:::tip
To split tests in the most efficient way possible, use:

- `spec` when the number of specs is less than the configured concurrency.
- `concurrency` when the number of specs is larger than the configured concurrency.
:::

---

### `shardTagsEnabled`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

When sharding is configured and the suite is configured to filter scenarios by [tags](#tags), it is possible for feature files to be allocated to VMs only to be skipped if the
feature file doesn't contain any scenarios matching the specified tags.

With `shardTagsEnabled` enabled, saucectl will filter out feature files that do not contain scenarios matching the given tags. This will prevent wasted VM allocations.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: A shard with tags example suite
    shard: spec
    shardTagsEnabled: true
    options:
      tags:
        - "@smoke and not @flakey"
```

---

### `timeout`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | DURATION |</small></p>

Instructs how long `saucectl` should wait for the suite to complete, potentially overriding the default project timeout setting.

When the suite reaches the timeout limit, its status is set to '?' in the CLI. This does not reflect the actual status of the job in the Sauce Labs web UI or API.

:::note
Setting `0` reverts to the value set in `defaults`.
:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    timeout: 15m
```

---

### `preExec`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING/ARRAY |</small></p>

Specifies which commands needs to be executed before the tests are actually started. The commands are executed from the root directory of your project.

:::note
There is a 300-second limit for all `preExec` commands to complete.
:::

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    preExec:
      - node ./scripts/pre-execution-script.js
```

---

### `passThreshold`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | INTEGER |</small></p>

Specifies the minimum number of successful attempts for a suite to be considered as `passed`. It should be used along with [retries](#retries).

:::note
For example, setting `retries` to 3 and `passThreshold` to 2.
The max attempt would be 4 times. If the test passed twice, it'd stop and be marked as `passed`. Otherwise, it'd be marked as `failed`.
:::

```yaml
sauce:
  retries: 3
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    passThreshold: 2
```

---

### `smartRetry`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | OBJECT |</small></p>

Specifies the retry strategy to apply for that suite. Requires [retries](#retries) to be >= 1.

```yaml
sauce:
  retries: 3
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    smartRetry:
      failedOnly: true
```

---

#### `failedOnly`

<p><small>| OPTIONAL | BOOLEAN |</small></p>

When set to `true`, only the spec files that failed during the previous attempt are retried.

```yaml
suites:
  - name: My Saucy Test
    smartRetry:
      failedOnly: true
```

---

### `options`
