## Setting a Custom Firefox Profile

If you ever have the need to mock video streams, such as a webcam, the browser
needs to be configured accordingly. Firefox does not provide a browser arg to
enable all flags necessaryâ€”they have to be set via the profile settings.

illustrates how you can configure saucectl to make use of an existing
preconfigured browser profile.
