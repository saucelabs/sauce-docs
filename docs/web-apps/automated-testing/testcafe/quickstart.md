Use `saucectl` — the Sauce Labs test orchestrator CLI — to run [TestCafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe) tests directly from your existing TestCafe project.

* Don't have TestCafe tests, but want to try? The TestCafe Demo Repo includes a sample project structure, working configuration file, and sample TestCafe test so you can get up and running in less than 10 minutes!
* Already running TestCafe? Let `saucectl` run your tests in the Sauce Labs Cloud, where you have access to thousands of OS/browser combinations and Sauce Labs analytics.  

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account (if you don't have one, start a [free trial](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* Your Sauce Labs [Username and Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to use the NPM package manager
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) account
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step 1: Install `saucectl`

```bash
npm install -g saucectl
```

## Step 2: Link Your Sauce Labs Account

`saucectl` requires access to a valid Sauce Labs account.

:::tip Use Environment Variables
`saucectl` detects your Sauce Labs credentials [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables) and prioritizes them over values in the `credentials.yml` file when both are present. **If you have set them, you may skip this step.** Not sure if you have them set? Run the following command to check:
```
echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
```
If a value is returned for both variables, they are set.
:::

 1. Run the `configure` command:

    ```
    saucectl configure
    ```
 1. Enter your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key at the prompts.


## Step 3: Clone the TestCafe Project

<Tabs
  defaultValue="https"
  values={[
    {label: 'HTTPS', value: 'https'},
    {label: 'SSH', value: 'ssh'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="https">

```
git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/saucectl-testcafe-example.git
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ssh">

```
git clone git@github.com:saucelabs/saucectl-testcafe-example.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Run Tests

Navigate to the root of the TestCafe project you just cloned, then use the `run` command to execute the sample test included with the `saucectl` example.

```
cd saucectl-testcafe-example
saucectl run
```

The console displays the executing tests, distinguishing which mode is running.

The results and test assets are available immediately following test completion in your [Sauce Labs account](https://app.saucelabs.com/dashboard/tests/vdc).
