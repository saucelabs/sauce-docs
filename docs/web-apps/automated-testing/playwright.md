[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is a testing framework that you can use to test your web apps &#8212; either locally in Docker or remotely on Sauce Labs Cloud &#8212; using the [`saucectl` CLI](/dev/cli/saucectl). This gives you the flexibility to run your tests in the environment that best suits your organization, while still benefiting from the Sauce Labs vast collection of devices, browser, and operating system combinations and test result data analytics.

## Supported Languages

JavaScript and TypeScript are supported out of the box.
Cucumber.js is not directly supported by Playwright. However, Playwright can be used as the backing automation framework. See [this setup guide](cucumberjs-playwright/quickstart.md) for more information.

## System Requirements

You can run Playwright locally via Docker ([Installation Requirements](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms)) or remotely via the Sauce Labs cloud, so system requirements vary depending on your intention. The following reference serves as a general guide:

Browser support for each framework is based on the Sauce Labs docker images provided in the `saucectl` installation. Each Docker image tag is the latest image that supports the specific framework version, as detailed in the available [release notes](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-playwright-runner).

## How to Get Started

- [Quickstart](/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright/quickstart): Use our demo repo to quickly set up and run a sample Playwright project and test to see the results.
- [Run your own tests](/web-apps/automated-testing/playwright/yaml): Customize `saucectl` to run your existing tests just by modifying the `config.yml` file for your project.
- [Incorporate `saucectl` in your pipeline](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/use-cases/#integrating-saucectl-in-your-ci-pipeline): Playwright on Sauce supports CI integrations with Circle CI, GitLab, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

## Limitations

:::caution Special Characters in Test Names
We recommend that you avoid the use of special characters when naming your tests. If your test name contains any special characters, your test may not run or its artifacts may not be visible in our platform.
:::

:::caution Playwright 1.31.1 + Webkit + Sauce-Connect
When using Sauce-Connect, Webkit browser is unable to load any website that is hosted on the Internet.
Local websites can still be loaded.
:::

:::caution macOS 11 + Playwright 1.29+ + Webkit
Webkit is not working on macOS 11 since Playwright 1.29.0
:::

:::note
Based on current playwright test runner implementation, there is no way to run Playwright test runner with Cucumber.
