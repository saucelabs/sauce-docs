[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is a testing framework that you can use to test your web applications either locally in Docker or through Sauce Labs using the [saucectl CLI](/testrunner-toolkit/saucectl), giving you the flexibility to run your tests in the environment that best suits your organization, while still benefiting from the Sauce Labs vast collection of devices, browser, and operating system combinations and test result data analytics.


### Supported Testing Platforms

 Sauce Labs supports the following test configurations for Playwright:

 <Tabs
   groupId="platforms"
   defaultValue="sauce"
   values={[
     {label: 'Sauce Labs', value: 'sauce'},
     {label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
   ]}>

 <TabItem value="sauce">

 |Playwright Version|Supported Platforms|Supported Browsers|
 |-----|-----|-----|
 |1.15.2|Windows 10|Chromium, Firefox, Webkit|
 |1.14.1|Windows 10|Chromium, Firefox, Webkit|
 |1.12.3|Windows 10|Chromium, Firefox, Webkit|
 |1.11.1|Windows 10|Chromium, Firefox, Webkit|
 |1.10.0|Windows 10|Chromium, Firefox, Webkit|

 </TabItem>
 <TabItem value="docker">

 Browser support for each framework is based on the Sauce Labs docker images provided in the `saucectl` installation. Each Docker image tag is the latest image that supports the specific framework version, as detailed in the available release notes.
