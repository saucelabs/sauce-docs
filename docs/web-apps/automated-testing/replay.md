[Replay](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay) is a library that provides an API to replay and stringify recordings created using [Chrome DevTools Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder). Using the [`saucectl` CLI](/dev/cli/saucectl), you can replay Chrome DevTools' JSON-based recordings remotely on Sauce Labs, giving you the flexibility of choosing browser version and operating system combinations and test result data analytics.

## Supported Testing Platforms

Sauce Labs supports the following test configurations for Replay:

- Browsers: Chrome
- Platforms: Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS 11, macOS 12, macOS 13

## How to Get Started

- [Quickstart](/web-apps/automated-testing/replay/quickstart): Use our demo repo to quickly set up and run a sample Replay project and test to see the results.
- [Run your own](/web-apps/automated-testing/replay/yaml): Customize `saucectl` to replay your existing recordings just by modifying the `config.yml` file for your project.
- [Incorporate saucectl in your pipeline](/dev/cli/saucectl/usage/use-cases/#integrating-saucectl-in-your-ci-pipeline): Replay in Sauce Labs supports CI integrations with Circle CI, GitLab, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
