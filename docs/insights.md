Insights is the reporting and analytics hub of your Sauce test suite. In it, you will find an interactive data center that can help you interpret your test results over time, identify failure patterns across different platforms, understand how parallel tests can improve your build efficiency, and home in on areas of your application that might benefit from deeper testing.

Learn more about how to use Insights to help you get the most out of your test results.
