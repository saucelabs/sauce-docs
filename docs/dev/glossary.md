## **A**

### Action RPG (ARPG)

This is typically a smaller role-playing game, usually small parties of 1-10 players, without all the depth of play offered by a full-fledged RPG. ARPGs will have tight, compact game experiences, where you have characters and loot that "persist" from session to session, but where the world the user plays in will be auto-generated at run-time.

### Alpha

See: _[Playtest](#playtest)_.

### Analytics

See: _[Insights](#insights)_.

### API Contract Testing

A lightweight form of API testing that checks each endpoint's contract -- that is, the content and format of static API requests and responses. It ensures that spec files (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI, and RAML) fulfill the contract between API consumers and producers.

More information: [Accelerating Releases with Quality: Contract Testing vs. E2E Functional Testing](https://saucelabs.com/blog/accelerating-releases-with-quality-contract-testing-vs-e2e-functional-testing).

## **G**

### Game Artist

Game Artists design preliminary sketches and develop them according to a video game's general style. They then create 2D or 3D animations from these sketches under the supervision of the Lead Artist. These elements create the world, its mood, and unique personality.

### Game Designers

Game designers have duties like designing characters, levels, puzzles, art and animation. They may also write code, using various computer programming languages. Depending on their career duties, they may also be responsible for project management tasks and testing early versions of video games.

### Game Engine

The “game engine” is the fundamental technology that the game lives on. In most cases, a game’s menuing system, networking layer, graphical presentation, user interface, everything, will be centered around a single gaming “engine”.<br/>
A game on a specific platform will never be based on more than one engine. The only time a game will be implemented on multiple engines is when the developer has to implement it on multiple platforms.<br/>
Given that more engines are being developed to work across platforms, developers are starting to prefer these engines, which is leading to considerable market consolidation.

### Game-Maker Studio

A series of cross-platform [Game Engines](#game-engine).

### Games as a service (GaaS)

Represents providing video games or game content on a continuing revenue model, similar to software as a service. Games as a service are ways to monetize video games either after their initial sale, or to support a free-to-play model. Games released under the GaaS model typically receive a long or indefinite stream of monetized new content over time to encourage players to continue paying to support the game.

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

A graphics processing unit is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

## **H**

### Headless Browser

- Make HTTP API requests (i.e., `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`) to a web server
- Generate API functional tests
- Import, store, and organize OpenAPI specs, Postman Collections, and API requests
- Use Sauce Connect Proxy to make calls to locally hosted APIs in a development environment

### Hybrid App

A mobile app written in platform-agnostic web technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Hybrid apps run inside a native container and leverage the device’s browser engine to render the HTML and process the JavaScript locally.

## **I**

### Image Injection

See: _[camera image injection](#camera-image-injection)_.

### In-House

- Many studios develop their own in-house game engine, for a variety of reasons. Many times it’s a matter of legacy: they’ve been doing it this way, so they need to keep doing it that way. Some of the older engines are starting to show their age in a way that’s unavoidable, so these companies are starting to migrate in the direction of Unreal or Unity.
- Another case for an in-house engine is the Decima engine is one example, used by publisher Guerilla Games to make Horizon: Zero Dawn. Whether it’s feature inadequacy, a long-term vision of monetizing a new engine as its own IP, or a specific problem with the other engines, this was the default for nearly all game studios throughout the 80s and 90s, and started to dwindle with the advent of Unreal in the late 90s.
- Though most companies use pre-built game engines, they still don’t have much in the way of automated testing or error/APM monitoring. That’s where Sauce Labs comes in.

### Instances

Platform dependent typically refers to applications that run under only one operating system in one series of computers (one operating environment).

### Playtest

A playtest is the process by which a game designer tests a new game for bugs and design flaws before releasing it to market. Playtests can be run "open", "closed", "beta", or otherwise, for which they have become an established part of the quality control process.

- **Alpha**: It is the phase of game testing where the game is still in the development phase along with which parallel testing is done to ensure that the game is developed without any glitches and is working smoothly without crashing.
- **Beta**: During beta testing, the game is almost production ready with all the major issues being fixed. In this phase, the game testers are required to extensively find all the possible ways to break the game along the lookout for all minor issues. During Beta Testing, the game needs to pass through many testing methodologies such as performance testing, stress testing, and game compliance testing.
  - **Open Beta Testing**: Open test is when the beta version of the game is made available for everyone interested. This interested group will play the game a share the reviews to the publisher. This process is also called as pre-release of the game software.
  - **Closed Beta Testing**: This testing is done only be the closed set of people who work closely with the game developers.
- **Release**: when the game is released to the public

### Playtester

A person--usually one of a large group, potentially hundreds for a AAA title--brought in, usually “cold”, to play the game before release. These players are usually disconnected from developers and aren’t involved in any decision-making--they just play the game under multiple types of observation, and put the game through its paces.

### Producer

Negotiate contracts, including licensing deals; Act as a liaison between the development staff and the upper stakeholders (publisher or executive staff); Develop and maintain schedules and budgets. Oversee creative (art and design) and technical development (game programming) of the game.

### Procedurally-Generated

A feature of Sauce Connect Proxy that automatically re-signs self-signed and invalid SSL certificates, which are not trusted by stock browsers like those installed on the Sauce Labs infrastructure. With SSL Bumping, your tests will not be interrupted with security warnings that can't be dismissed by Selenium. More information: [SSL Certificate Bumping](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/security-authentication#ssl-certificate-bumping).

### Stacktrace

In computing, a stack trace (also called stack backtrace or stack traceback) is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. When a program is run, memory is often dynamically allocated in two places; the stack and the heap.

- Programmers commonly use stack tracing during interactive and post-mortem debugging. End-users may see a stack trace displayed as part of an error message, which the user can then report to a programmer.

### Stress Testing

A test method where you purposely put your system under extreme conditions – above and beyond your requirements – to identify the breaking point and determine if and when your system fails gracefully.

### systemd

A Linux service management tool that facilitates Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel monitoring, system startup and shutdown. More information: [Monitoring Sauce Connect Proxy with Service Management Tools](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels#service-management-tools).

### Sharding

Sharding is a form of database partitioning, also known as horizontal partitioning.The process involves breaking up a very large database into smaller, more manageable segments, with the idea of improving performance and reducing the query response time.

- The term was popularized by Ultima Online, in which developers split players across different servers (different “worlds” in the game) to cope with the traffic.
- In business, a common example of sharding a large database is to break up the customer database into geographic locations. Customers in the same geographic locations are grouped together and placed on unique servers.

See also: _[sauce connect proxy](#sauce-connect-proxy)._

### Tunnel Identifier

See: [Tunnel Name](#tunnel-name)

### Tunnel Name

The Sauce Connect Proxy test configuration option that allows you to assign a name to your tunnel(s), giving you more control and monitoring capability over the tunnel. If you launch a tunnel without naming it, your test traffic will default to running through that unnamed tunnel. More information: [Using Tunnel Names](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/basic-setup/#using-tunnel-names).

See also: _[colliding tunnels](#colliding-tunnels)_.

### Tunnel Pool

### Unity

One of the three most well-known [game engines](#game-engine) in the world. Unity is a cross-platform engine, allowing developers to create a “core” game, which can then be played on PC, Mac, iOS, PlayStation, xBox, and other platforms with minimal extra effort.

- Developers will choose Unity for games that need to work flawlessly across platforms, but which might not take full advantage of the most advanced gaming hardware or performance. If they need to render millions of triangles, Unity won’t cut it. If they need to stand up a simpler game that works on all major platforms, Unity is the right choice.
- Side-scrollers, RTS, puzzle, slower VR titles, some RPGs - these are excellent candidates for Unity.
