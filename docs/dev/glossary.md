## **A**

### Analytics

See: _[Insights](#insights)_.


### API Contract Testing

A lightweight form of API testing that checks each endpoint's contract -- that is, the content and format of static API requests and responses. It ensures that spec files (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI, and RAML) fulfill the contract between API consumers and producers.

More information: [Accelerating Releases with Quality: Contract Testing vs. E2E Functional Testing](https://saucelabs.com/blog/accelerating-releases-with-quality-contract-testing-vs-e2e-functional-testing).


### API E2E Testing

An API testing method that validates the logic of dynamic APIs, ensuring that the API consumer can fully support the user storyâ€™s goals.

More information: [Accelerating Releases with Quality: Contract Testing vs. E2E Functional Testing](https://saucelabs.com/blog/accelerating-releases-with-quality-contract-testing-vs-e2e-functional-testing).


### API Mocking

An API server that mimics a real API server's requests and responses, which are based on the data from the spec file you provide. Commonly used for testing and debugging APIs while they're still in development; environment is stable and third-party dependencies are not required.

The Sauce Labs API Mocking tool is called Piestry. See: _[Piestry](#piestry)_.


### API Monitoring

Refers to the Sauce Labs API Testing functionality accessible from your Project Dashboard, where you can view testing activity, metrics, test outcome reports, tags, schedule tests, and more.


### Appium

An open source mobile UI automation framework that uses the Selenium WebDriver protocol to control interaction with native apps, mobile web apps, and hybrid apps in your tests. Appium acts as a wrapper that translates Selenium WebDriver commands into iOS and Android commands. With Sauce Labs, you can use Appium to test mobile apps on emulators, simulators, and real devices.

See also: _[selenium](#selenium)_, _[webdriver](#webdriver)_.


### App Under Test (AUT)

A web or mobile app in the test phase of the software development cycle.

See also: _[software development lifecycle](#software-development-lifecycle-sdlc)_.


### Automated Testing

## **B**

### Build

1. A suite of individual Sauce Labs tests on various parts (e.g., page objects) of a website or app using any platform/browser combination, bundled together in the same session. A build is defined when you add the same build number to the code for tests in that suite. More information: [Best Practice: Use Build IDs, Tags, and Names to Identify Your Tests](/basics/test-config-annotation/test-annotation/#use-build-ids-tags-and-names-to-identify-your-tests).

You can integrate Sauce Performance, our front-end performance testing tool, with your existing CI/CD workflows. Front-end testing - using tools like Google Lighthouse and GTmetrix - measures how quickly you can see and interact with your website. It doesn't have back-end load testing functionality, where you'd use tools like JMeter, Gatling. More information: [Getting Started with Sauce Front-End Performance](/performance), [Sauce Labs White Paper: Best Practices for Front-End Performance Testing](https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/best-practices-for-front-end-performance-testing).
