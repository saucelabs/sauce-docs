To use Microsoft SQL database query via Sauce Labs Low Code: 
1. Connect to the database 
2. Execute a query 
3. Extract the value 

### Connect to the Database

Connect to db "" with url `jdbc:sqlserver://<IP:Port>` with user as `<username>` and password as `<password>` with db_id `<Db_id>`. 

#### Example 

To connect to db "" with url 
`jdbc:sqlserver://sql-server-2030.cgck8ublk7h6.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:1433` with user as `devops` and password `test456!@!` with db_id `test` 

:::note
`Db_id` is the connection id used by Sauce Labs to identify different DB sessions. 
:::

### Execute a Query

Syntax: 
execute query `<query>` against `<Db_id>` and save it as `<variable name>` 

#### Example 
Execute query `select *from testDB.user` against `test` and save it as `query_data` 

### Extract the Value
We can use js or py snippets to parse the output value. 

#### Example 
Save:`_js{return eval(${query_data})[1][1]}` 
as: `fname` 
Where query_data (input): 
```
[[1000, "James", "Bond"], [1001, "Roger", "Federer"], [1002, "Rafael", "Nadal"]] 
fname(Output):: 
Roger
```
