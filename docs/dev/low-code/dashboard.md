The dashboard is the landing page from which you can access the **Plan**, **Execute**, and **Analyze** steps, as well as view and modify your profile and account information.

The dashboard includes detail cards that show you a snapshot of information related to your projects and tests, and provides links to the relevant pages to view, manage, and create tests.

## Dashboard Detail Cards
The dashboard detail cards give a quick look at data that might be important to you. Each card displays the time period of the data in the lower-left corner, which can be modified in the **Dashboard Management** settings.

Clicking the maximize icon will open a larger version of the details card, and clicking the collapse icon will collapse the card on the dashboard.
