# Sc Run

Usage: `sc run --username <username> --access-key <UUID> --region <data center> --tunnel-name <value> [flags]`

Run Sauce Connect Proxy

**Note:** You can also specify the options as YAML, JSON or TOML file using `--config-file` flag.
You can generate a config file by running `sc run config-file` command.


## Required

### `-k, --access-key` {#access-key}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`
* Value Format: `<UUID>`

Sauce Labs Access Key, you can get it from the [User Settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings).
For additional security, we recommend setting this as an environment variable.

* Value Format: `<name>`

Name of the tunnel or tunnel pool.
You can run tests using this tunnel by specifying the tunnelName value in your test capabilities, see [here](/dev/test-configuration-options/).
It can also assign a name to a group of tunnels in the same high availability pool, see [here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/high-availability/).

### `-u, --username` {#username}

Custom metadata key-value pairs.
This flag is, primarily, used by Sauce Labs to assign custom properties to the tunnel for reporting purposes.

### `-s, --shared` {#shared}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_SHARED`
* Value Format: `<all>`

Share the tunnel within the same org unit.
Only the 'all' option is currently supported.
See [here](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/sauce-connect-proxy-tunnels/).

### `-t, --tunnel-pool` {#tunnel-pool}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_TUNNEL_POOL`
* Value Format: `<value>`
* Default value: `false`

Denotes a tunnel as part of a high availability tunnel pool.

## Tunnel traffic

### `-F, --deny-domains` {#deny-domains}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_DENY_DOMAINS`
* Value Format: `[-]<regexp>,...`

Deny requests to the matching domains.
Prefix domains with '-' to exclude requests from being denied.
Special keyword 'all' matches all domains.

The following example denies requests to *.example.com and *.google.com.
```
--deny-domains .*\.example\.com,.*\.google\.com
```


### `-D, --direct-domains` {#direct-domains}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_DIRECT_DOMAINS`
* Value Format: `[-]<regexp>,...`

Forward matching requests to their origin server over the public internet.
Requests that don't match "direct domains" will be forwarded to customer-side over the Sauce Connect Proxy connection.
You can specify --direct-domains or --tunnel-domains, but not both.
Prefix domains with '-' to exclude requests from being forwarded directly.
Note that direct domains are automatically excluded from being resigned.
Special keyword 'all' matches all domains.

The following example sends requests to *.example.com and *.google.com directly.
It would tunnel all other domains.
```
--direct-domains .*\.example\.com,.*\.google\.com
```


### `-B, --tls-passthrough-domains` {#tls-passthrough-domains}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_TLS_PASSTHROUGH_DOMAINS`

Requests that don't match will be re-encrypted.
You can specify --tls-passthrough-domains or --tls-resign-domains, but not both.
Prefix domains with '-' to exclude requests from being passed through.
Note that direct domains will always be passed through.
Special keyword 'all' matches all domains.

The following example passes requests to *.example.com and *.google.com through without SSL/TLS re-encryption.
```
--tls-passthrough-domains .*\.example\.com,.*\.google\.com
```


### `-b, --tls-resign-domains` {#tls-resign-domains}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_TLS_RESIGN_DOMAINS`
* Value Format: `[-]<regexp>,...`

Resign SSL/TLS certificates for matching requests.
You can specify --tls-resign-domains or --tls-passthrough-domains, but not both.
Prefix domains with '-' to exclude requests from being resigned.
Note that direct domains will never be resigned.
Special keyword 'all' matches all domains.

The following example resigns SSL/TLS certificates for all requests to *.myorg.dev, except abc.myorg.dev.
```
--tls-resign-domains .*\.myorg\.dev,-abc\.myorg\.dev
```


### `-T, --tunnel-domains` {#tunnel-domains}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_TUNNEL_DOMAINS`
* Value Format: `[-]<regexp>,...`

Forward matching requests over the Sauce Connect Proxy connection.
Requests not matching "tunnel domains" will be forwarded to their origin server over the public internet.
This is the recommended option for the best performance since it minimizes the expensive tunnelled traffic and uses it only for internal domains that are not publicly available.
You can specify --tunnel-domains or --direct-domains, but not both.
Prefix domains with '-' to exclude requests from being forwarded over the SC Proxy connection.
Special keyword 'all' matches all domains.

The following example tunnels all requests to *.myorg.dev, except abc.myorg.com.
```
--tunnel-domains .*\.myorg\.dev,-abc\.myorg\.com
```


## Proxy

### `-a, --auth` {#auth}

* Environment variable: `SAUCE_AUTH`

Site or upstream proxy basic authentication credentials.
The host and port can be set to "*" to match all hosts and ports respectively.
The flag can be specified multiple times to add multiple credentials.
Note that all the hosts are automatically resigned as if they were passed to --tls-resign-domains flag.

Example:
```
--proxy myproxy.org:3128 --proxy-sauce https://external.com:443 --auth user1:pass1@myproxy.org:3128,user2:pass2@external.com:*

## Formatting Domains

Here are some guidelines to follow when formatting domain regular expressions:

- Use only the domain name. Do not precede it with `http:` or `https:`.
	- Example: `mydomain\.com`
- Make sure your comma-separated list of domains doesn't include any spaces.
	- Example, `mydomain\.com,saucelabs.com,mysite\.com`
- Domains flags can be repeated multiple times
	- Example, `--direct-domains mydomain\.com,saucelabs\.com --direct-domains mysite\.com`
- Prefix domain names with `.*` to match all its subdomains.
	- Example: You could refer to `docs\.saucelabs\.com` and `my\.saucelabs\.com` as `.*saucelabs\.com`.
- Escape special characters, such as `.` to ensure they are not parsed
	- Not escaping dot character doesn't result in error, dot matches every single character except a newline. For example, `example.com` will match `example.com` and also `examplescom`, while `example\.com` will match `example.com` only.
