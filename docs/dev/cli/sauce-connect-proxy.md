__Description__: Sets the local path to a YAML file containing a Sauce Connect Proxy configuration. An example YAML configuration file, `config.yaml`, is included for your reference as part of the Sauce Connect Proxy download package. We recommend using a YAML configuration file in production environments, rather than command-line options, as it facilitates tracking configuration changes, managing tunnel-domains and direct-domains options (which can get very long), and securing Sauce Connect Proxy credentials with tighter access control over the config file.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-c`


---
### `--tunnel-pool` or `--no-remove-colliding-tunnels`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

:::caution
Effective with Sauce Connect Proxy version 4.7.0, `--no-remove-colliding-tunnels` was deprecated and replaced by `--tunnel-pool`.

__Default__: `us-west`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-r`


---
### `--rest-url`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

:::caution
Effective with Sauce Connect Proxy version 4.7.0, we recommend using `--region` over `--rest-url`.

### `--tunnel-name` or `--tunnel-identifier`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

:::caution
Effective with version 4.7.0, `--tunnel-identifier` was deprecated and replaced by `--tunnel-name`.
:::

__Description__: Assigns an ID to a Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel. While not required, this option is strongly recommended. Future jobs will use this tunnel only when explicitly specified by the [tunnelIdentifier](/dev/test-configuration-options#tunnelidentifier) in the desired capabilities of your automated tests.

To learn about the syntax for setting this as a capability, see [Test Configuration Options](/dev/test-configuration-options). For information on using this option in the tunnel pool, see [High Availability Setup](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/high-availability).

:::note
HTTP Header Injection is disabled for all HTTPS domains passed to --no-ssl-bump-domains argument.
:::

__Shorthand__: `-B`


## External Proxy Configuration

---
### `--no-autodetect`

```

---
### `--pac-auth`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

For more information about the `-T `option and configuring Sauce Connect Proxy with other proxies, see [Set Up with Additional Proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/additional-proxies). You'll need to use this option if you have a PAC file that contains Sauce Labs DNS names.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-T`


---
### `--proxy-userpwd`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Requires username and password to be sent via basic authentication to access the proxy configured with `-p` (`--proxy`). For more information, see [Set Up with Additional Proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/additional-proxies).

Sauce Connect Proxy versions older than 4.6.1 do not support the `-p` option combined with `--pac`. Update to the latest version [here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation).<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-w`



## Client Configuration

---
### `--pidfile`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Specifies the file where you want the Sauce Connect Proxy process ID (pid) to be written. This is useful for programmatically stopping Sauce Connect Proxy. Although Sauce Connect Proxy makes a best effort, we cannot guarantee that the pidfile will be removed when shutting down Sauce Connect Proxy. With that in mind, relying on the pidfile as a means to monitor Sauce Connect Proxy is not supported.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-d`


---
### `--readyfile`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Sets file that will be touched to indicate when the tunnel is ready.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-f`

__Description__: Sets the port on which Sauce Connect Proxy's Selenium relay will listen for requests. Selenium commands reaching Sauce Connect Proxy on this port will be relayed to Sauce Labs securely and reliably through Sauce Connect Proxy's tunnel. This feature is disabled unless specified. For more information, see [Using the Selenium Relay](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels).<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-P`


## Networking and Security

---
### `--auth`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Performs basic authentication when a URL on `host:port` asks for a username and password. This option can be used multiple times. For examples, see [Authentication Using `--auth`](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/security-authentication).

Sauce Connect Proxy's `--auth` flag will only send the header Authorization with a type of 'Basic'. If a resource responds with the header WWW-Authenticate of a type any other than 'Basic,' your authentication will fail and return a non-200 HTTP response. HTTP Header Injection is disabled for SSL domains that are not re-encrypted by Sauce Connect Proxy, which means performing basic authentication in this way is disabled for all HTTPS domains passed to `--no-ssl-bump-domains` argument.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-a` <br/>

```java
--auth mysite.com:80:awesometester:supersekrit
```

---
### `--cainfo`

__Description__: Directory of CA certs to use for verifying connections to Sauce Labs REST API.<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a  


---
### `--dns`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Uses specified name server. To specify multiple servers, separate them with a comma. Use IP addresses, optionally with a port number, the two separated by a colon.<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a

```java
--dns 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4:53
```

---
### `--ocsp`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: OSCP verification mode. Options are strict, attempt, log-only, and disable. The default is log-only.

:::note
`--ocsp strict` may fail if a certificate in the chain does not support OCSP. It's recommended to leave it to the default "log-only" mode.
:::

__Shorthand__: n/a  


---
### `--tunnel-cainfo`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: CA certificate bundle to use for verifying tunnel connections.<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a  


---

__Description__: Use this option to define the host:port for the internal web server used to expose client side metrics. The default is `localhost:8888`.<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a  


---
### `--verbose`
__Description__: Enables verbose debugging. Use this to log HTTP headers or debug Sauce Connect connection.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-v`

:::note
You can also use `-vv` (very verbose), which outputs HTTP headers and KGP logs, although it's recommended for troubleshooting purposes only because it's system-resource demanding and can adversely affect Sauce Connect Proxy performance.
:::


## Other Options

---
### `--scproxy-read-limit`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | NUMBER |</small></p>

__Description__: Rates limit reads in scproxy to the number of bytes per second that you specify. This option can be used to adjust local network transfer rate to prevent overloading the tunnel connection.<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a


---
### `--scproxy-write-limit`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | NUMBER |</small></p>

__Description__: Rates limit writes in scproxy to the number of bytes per second that you specify. This option can be used to adjust local network transfer rate to prevent overloading the tunnel connection.<br/>

## Formatting Domains in the Command Line

Here are some guidelines to follow when formatting domains:

* Use only the domain name. Do not precede it with `http:` or `https:`
  * Example: `mydomain.com`
* Make sure your comma-separated list of domains doesn't include any spaces.
  * Example, `mydomain.com,saucelabs.com,mysite.com`
* Prefix domain names with `*.` or simply `.` to match all its subdomains.
  * Example: You could refer to `docs.saucelabs.com` and `my.saucelabs.com` as "`*.saucelabs.com"` or` ".saucelabs.com"`. Enclose the argument in quotes to prevent shell expansion of asterisk.
* If you don't want any domains to be SSL re-encrypted, you can specify `all` with the argument (i.e., `-B all` or `--no-ssl-bump-domains all`)
* WebSockets domains are not compatible with SSL bumping, so you'll need to disable SSL Bumping for those.
