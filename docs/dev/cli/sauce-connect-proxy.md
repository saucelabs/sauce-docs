__Shorthand__: n/a


---
### `--proxy-tunnel`
__Description__: Routes all tunnel traffic through the external proxy specified by [`--proxy`](#--proxy). Uses the proxy configured with `--proxy` or `--pac` for the tunnel connection. For more information about the `-T` option and configuring Sauce Connect Proxy with other proxies, see [Set Up with Additional Proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/additional-proxies). You'll need to use this option if you have a PAC file that contains Sauce Labs DNS names.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-T`


---
### `--proxy-userpwd`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Sets username and password (sent via basic authentication) to access the proxy configured with [--proxy](#--proxy). For more information, see [Set Up with Additional Proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/additional-proxies).<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-w`



## Client Configuration

---
### `--logfile`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Captures the Sauce Connect Proxy logs in a file. If a path is not specified, the file location will default to the location where the Sauce Connect Proxy executable can be found on your machine.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-l`


---
### `--max-logsize`

__Shorthand__: n/a


---
### `--pidfile`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Specifies the file where you want the Sauce Connect Proxy process ID (pid) to be written. This is useful for programmatically stopping Sauce Connect Proxy. Although Sauce Connect Proxy makes a best effort, we cannot guarantee that the pidfile will be removed when shutting down Sauce Connect Proxy. With that in mind, relying on the pidfile as a means to monitor Sauce Connect Proxy is not supported.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-d`

Selenium commands reaching Sauce Connect Proxy on this port will be relayed to Sauce Labs securely and reliably through Sauce Connect Proxy's tunnel. This feature is disabled unless specified. For more information, see [Using the Selenium Relay](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels).<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-P`


## Networking and Security

---
### `--auth`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

Sauce Connect Proxy's `--auth` flag will only send the header Authorization with a type of 'Basic'. If a resource responds with the header WWW-Authenticate of a type any other than 'Basic,' your authentication will fail and return a non-200 HTTP response. HTTP Header Injection is disabled for SSL domains that are not re-encrypted by Sauce Connect Proxy, which means performing basic authentication in this way is disabled for all HTTPS domains passed to `--no-ssl-bump-domains` argument.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-a` <br/>

```java
--auth mysite.com:80:awesometester:supersekrit
```

---
### `--cainfo`

```

---
### `--tunnel-cainfo`

__Shorthand__: n/a  


---
### `--ocsp`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: OCSP verification mode. Options are: strict, log-only, and disable. The default is log-only.

:::note
`--ocsp strict` may fail if a certificate in the chain does not support OCSP. It's recommended to leave it to the default "log-only" mode.
:::

__Shorthand__: n/a  

---
### `--tunnel-capath`
<p><small><span className="sauceGold">DEPRECATED</span></small></p>

__Description__: Directory of CA certificates to use for verifying tunnel connections. Effective with Sauce Connect Proxy version 4.7.0, `--tunnel-capath` was deprecated. Upgrade to the latest version [here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/).<br/>

---
### `--capath`
<p><small><span className="sauceGold">DEPRECATED</span></small></p>

__Description__: Defines a directory of CA certs to use for verifying connections to Sauce Labs REST API. Effective with Sauce Connect Proxy version 4.7.0, `--capath` was deprecated. Upgrade to the latest version [here](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/).<br/>



## Troubleshooting and Debugging

---
### `--log-stats`

__Shorthand__: n/a  


---
### `--verbose`
__Description__: Enables verbose debugging. Use this to log HTTP headers or debug Sauce Connect connection.<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-v`

:::note
You can also use `-vv` (very verbose), which outputs HTTP headers and KGP logs, although it's recommended for troubleshooting purposes only because it's system-resource demanding and can adversely affect Sauce Connect Proxy performance.
:::


## Other Options

---
### `--scproxy-read-limit`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | NUMBER |</small></p>

__Description__: Rates limit reads in scproxy to the number of bytes per second that you specify. This option can be used to adjust local network transfer rate to prevent overloading the tunnel connection.<br/>

## Formatting Domains in the Command Line

Here are some guidelines to follow when formatting domains:

* Use only the domain name. Do not precede it with `http:` or `https:`
  * Example: `mydomain.com`
* Make sure your comma-separated list of domains doesn't include any spaces.
  * Example, `mydomain.com,saucelabs.com,mysite.com`
* Prefix domain names with `*.` or simply `.` to match all its subdomains.
  * Example: You could refer to `docs.saucelabs.com` and `my.saucelabs.com` as "`*.saucelabs.com"` or` ".saucelabs.com"`. Enclose the argument in quotes to prevent shell expansion of asterisk.
* If you don't want any domains to be SSL re-encrypted, you can specify `all` with the argument (i.e., `-B all` or `--no-ssl-bump-domains all`)
* WebSockets domains are not compatible with SSL bumping, so you'll need to [disable SSL Bumping](#--no-ssl-bump-domains) for those.
