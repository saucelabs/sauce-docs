## Main

---
### `--user`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Sets your Sauce Labs username. For additional security, you can set this as an [environment variable](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/environment-variables/).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_USERNAME` or `SAUCE_USER`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-u`

---
### `--api-key`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Sets your Sauce Labs API key. This will be the same as your [Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings). For additional security, you can set this as an [environment variable](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/environment-variables/).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` or `SAUCE_API_KEY`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-k`

---
### `--config-file`
<p><small>| REQUIRED | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Defines the local path to a YAML file containing a Sauce Connect Proxy configuration. For instructions, [Configuring Tunnels with a YAML File](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/yaml-config/).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: n/a<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-c`

:::caution
This is required only if you're using a YAML file to configure your tunnels.
:::

---
### `--region`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Sets your Sauce Labs [data center endpoint](/basics/data-center-endpoints/#data-center-endpoints) (e.g., `us-west`, `eu-central`, `apac-southeast`).<br/>
__Default__: If you don't specify a data center, Sauce Connect will default to `us-west`. <br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_REGION`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-r`

```bash
#US-West-1
./sc -u $SAUCE_USERNAME -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY --region us-west

./sc -u $SAUCE_USERNAME -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY --region eu-central

#APAC-Southeast-1
./sc -u $SAUCE_USERNAME -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY --region apac-southeast
```

:::caution
Not compatible with versions below 4.7.0, which use the [`--rest-url`](#--rest-url) flag to define the region. We recommend using `--region` instead of `--rest-url` to keep your CLI options more readable.
:::


---
### `--shared-tunnel`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL |</small></p>

__Description__: changes tunnel sharing permissions so that all users in an organization can use Sauce Connect Proxy tunnels, rather than just the tunnel owner (admin). For more information, see [Sharing Sauce Connect Proxy Tunnels](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/sauce-connect-proxy-tunnels).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_SHARED_TUNNEL`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-s`

---
### `--tunnel-identifier`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Assigns a name to a Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel. It can also assign a name to a group of tunnels in the same [High Availability pool](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/high-availability), when used with [`--tunnel-pool`](#--tunnel-pool). Must be in ASCII format.

You can run tests using this tunnel by specifying the [`tunnelIdentifier`](/dev/test-configuration-options/#tunnelidentifier) in your test capabilities. To learn about the syntax for setting this as a capability, see [Test Configuration Options](/dev/test-configuration-options).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_TUNNEL_IDENTIFIER`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-i`

:::note Tunnel Identifier = Tunnel Name
This value populates the **Tunnel Name** field on the Sauce Labs Tunnels page, _not_ the **Tunnel ID** (which is an auto-generated tunnel UUID). In Sauce Connect v4.7.0 and later, you can use the flags `tunnel-identifier` or `--tunnel-name` interchangeably.
:::

---
### `--tunnel-pool`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Launches a high availability tunnel pool along with the [`--tunnel-identifier`](#--tunnel-identifier) flag. For more info, see [High Availability Setup](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/high-availability).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: n/a<br/>

__Description__: Sets the port on which Sauce Connect Proxy's Selenium relay will listen for requests. Selenium commands reaching Sauce Connect Proxy on this port will be relayed to Sauce Labs securely and reliably through Sauce Connect Proxy's tunnel. This feature is disabled unless specified. For more information, see [Using the Selenium Relay](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/proxy-tunnels).<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_SE_PORT`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-P`


## Networking and Security

---
### `--auth`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: Performs basic authentication when a URL on `host:port` asks for a username and password (`host:port:username:password` format). This option can be used multiple times. For examples, see [Authentication Using `--auth`](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/security-authentication).

This flag will only send the header Authorization with a type of "Basic." If a resource responds with the header WWW-Authenticate of a type any other than "Basic," your authentication will fail and return a non-200 HTTP response. HTTP Header Injection is disabled for SSL domains that are not re-encrypted by Sauce Connect Proxy, which means performing basic authentication in this way is disabled for all HTTPS domains passed to `--no-ssl-bump-domains` argument.<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_AUTH`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-a`

```java
--auth mysite.com:80:awesometester:supersekrit
```

---
### `--cainfo`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Shorthand__: n/a

```java
--dns 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4:53
```

---
### `--tunnel-cainfo`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: CA certificate bundle in PEM format to use for verifying tunnel connections. This is normally used when a proxy is needed to access the tunnel endpoint, and the proxy's certificate isn't available in the system certificate store. This does <b>not</b> affect test traffic through Sauce Connect.<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_TUNNEL_CAINFO`<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a


---
### `--ocsp`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | STRING |</small></p>

__Description__: OCSP verification mode. Options are: strict, log-only, and disable. The default is log-only.<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_OCSP`<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a

:::note
`--ocsp strict` may fail if a certificate in the chain does not support OCSP. We recommend leaving it as the default "log-only" mode.
:::

---
### `--tunnel-capath`
<p><small><span className="sauceGold">DEPRECATED</span></small></p>

__Description__: Directory of CA certificates to use for verifying tunnel connections.<br/>

__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_METRICS_ADDRESS`<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a


---
### `--verbose`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL |</small></p>

__Description__: Enables verbose debugging. Use this to log HTTP headers or debug Sauce Connect connection. You can also use `-vv` (very verbose), which outputs HTTP headers and KGP logs, although it's recommended for troubleshooting purposes only because it's system-resource demanding and can adversely affect Sauce Connect Proxy performance.<br/>
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_VERBOSE`<br/>
__Shorthand__: `-v`


## Other Options

---
### `--scproxy-read-limit`
<p><small>| OPTIONAL | NUMBER |</small></p>

|`reply_body_max_size`| Set limit to the reply body size (the default is 500 MB).|```--extra-info '{"reply_body_max_size": "30 MB"}'```|

You can specify a combination of several options. For example:

```bash
--extra-info '{"inject-forwarded-for": true, "reply_body_max_size": "300 MB"}'
```
__Enviroment variable__: `SAUCE_EXTRA_INFO`<br/>
__Shorthand__: n/a


## Formatting Domains

Here are some guidelines to follow when formatting domains:

* Use only the domain name. Do not precede it with `http:` or `https:`.
  * Example: `mydomain.com`
* Make sure your comma-separated list of domains doesn't include any spaces.
  * Example, `mydomain.com,saucelabs.com,mysite.com`
* Prefix domain names with a dot `.` to match all its subdomains.
  * Example: You could refer to `docs.saucelabs.com` and `my.saucelabs.com` as "`*.saucelabs.com"` or` ".saucelabs.com"`. Enclose the argument in quotes to prevent shell expansion of asterisk.
* If you don't want any domains to be SSL re-encrypted, you can specify `all` with the argument (i.e., `-B all` or `--no-ssl-bump-domains all`)
* WebSockets domains are not compatible with SSL bumping, so you'll need to [disable SSL Bumping](#--no-ssl-bump-domains) for those.
