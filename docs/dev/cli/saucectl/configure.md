## Description

Generate a credentials file with your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key.

## Usage

<span className="cli">$ saucectl configure [OPTIONS]</span>


## Extended Description

Your Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` are required to post your test results to the Sauce Labs platform. These values are available on your [User Settings](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) page.

The `saucectl configure` command prompts you to provide your Sauce Labs credentials for the purpose of generating a `credentials.yml` file that `saucectl` can access to automatically authenticate commands without requiring manual authentication. The `credentials.yml` file is created in a `.sauce` folder in your `saucectl` project root.

You can run the `configure` command without flags, invoking it to prompt you for your credential values, or you can supply the values inline using the username and access key flags.

### Environment Variables Prioritized

If you have set your credentials as [environment variables](/basics/environment-variables), `saucectl` will apply those values before it looks for the `credentials.yml` file. This is important to note because, if you want to run tests under a different account, and you edit your credentials file, but not your environment variables, the authentication account will be unchanged.

:::warning Protect your Credentials
Whether you are using environment variables or a credentials file, make sure your authentication data is protected. Use secrets or context variables to mask your environment variables, or add `credentials.yml` to your `gitignore` file to ensure your credentials are not exposed in your commits.
