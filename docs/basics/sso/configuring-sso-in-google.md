The Sauce Labs SAML app is not available in [Google SAML catalog](https://support.google.com/a/topic/7417510) as Google has paused processing new requests from App Developers. You can integrate with Sauce Labs by setting up a [custom SAML application](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519) using the [configuration details for custom setup](/basics/sso/setting-up-sso#service-provider-saml-requirements).
