:::caution
This SSO flow has been `deprecated`. Use this documentation only if your organization was not migrated to the new SSO.

If you do not have any SSO integrations set up at Sauce Labs and you wish to establish a new integration, see [Setting Up SSO](/basics/sso/setting-up-sso) to get started.

If you have previously implemented the deprecated SSO integration and wish to migrate to the new SSO implementation, see the [step-by-step migration guide](/basics/sso/migration-from-deprecated-sso/).

Sauce Labs supports Idp-initiated SSO, which allows your authorized employees to access Sauce Labs in a moderated fashion.
