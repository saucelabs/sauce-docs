The Sauce Labs Webhooks integration allows you specify a URL to which Sauce Labs will push test result data as it becomes available, rather than forcing you to constantly poll for updates.

## What You'll Need

* A Sauce Labs account (if you don't have one, start a [free trial](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up))
* Your Sauce Labs [Username and Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)
* A URL able to consume events data pushed from Sauce Labs


## Configure a Webhook

1. From your Sauce Labs account, navigate to the [Account Integrations](https://app.staging.saucelabs.net/integrations) page.
1. Click the Webhooks **Enable** button.
1. Enter the URL of the endpoint to which you would like Sauce Labs events pushed.
1. Select the events you wish to receive:
    * **Virtual Devices**: Receive test result events for jobs run on Sauce Labs desktop browsers and mobile emulators and simulators.
    * <small><span className="sauceDBlue">Coming Soon</span></small> <b>Real Devices</b>: Receive test result events for Appium jobs run on Sauce Labs real devices.
1. For each selected event type, choose whether you wish to receive data for all completed tests or only tests that failed.
1. Click **Save** to complete your configuration. Your webhook enablement appears under the **Saved Configurations** section. You can configure up to ten webhook integrations.

:::note Multiple Data Centers
Webhooks are specific to the data center that is active for your Sauce Labs account during integration. If you have access to multiple data centers, you must switch into each data center and repeat the webhooks setup process in order to push jobs data from both data centers to the configured webhook.

## Delete a Webhook

1. From your Sauce Labs account, navigate to the [Account Integrations](https://app.staging.saucelabs.net/integrations) page.
1. Click the Webhooks **Enable** button.
1. In the **Saved Configurations** section, click the trashcan icon of the webhook configuration you wish to delete.
