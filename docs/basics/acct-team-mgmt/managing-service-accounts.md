## Overview

Service accounts are non-human accounts designed for automated processes such as CI/CD pipelines and integrations.

:::tip
Throughout this documentation, non-human accounts will always be referred to as **service accounts**. In contrast, accounts associated with individual users and linked to an email address will be referred to as **users** or **user accounts**.
:::

Service accounts can be managed by any team administrator in their active team or any organization administrator.

Unlike user accounts, service accounts:

- Are not tied to a specific user and remain functional even if the creator is deleted.
- Cannot switch teams after creation.

Key characteristics:

- **No UI or SAML SSO Sign-In:** Service accounts cannot log in to the Sauce Labs UI or via SAML Single Sign-On.
- **No Email Notifications:** They do not have an email address and will not receive notifications.
- **Credentials for Automation:** They use a username and access key for API access and running tests as user accounts.
- **Team Assignment:** Once created, a service account is tied to a specific team and cannot be reassigned.
- **Limited Permissions:** Service accounts have limited permissions compared to user accounts, amongst others they **cannot**:
  - manage teams and accounts ([Accounts API](/dev/api/accounts/))
  - manage tunnels with Sauce Trusted Connection ([Sauce Connect API](/dev/api/connect/), [SC CLI 4](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy), [SC CLI 5](/dev/cli/sauce-connect-5))
  - manage private real devices ([Private Real Device API](/dev/api/rdc/#private-real-device-management))
  - use the [API Testing API](/dev/api/api-testing/)
  - submit a crash in the [Crash/Error Reporting](/dev/api/error-reporting/)
  - use the [Virtual USB CLI](/dev/cli/virtual-usb/)

## Creating a Service Account

## Running Tests as a Service Account

You can run tests as a service account in the same way you would with a user account - use the service account's username and access key.

### Viewing Test Results

Jobs run by service accounts are displayed on the [Automated Test Results page](/test-results/viewing-test-results/#automated-test-results). The visibility and permissions for jobs and builds run by service accounts are the same as those for user accounts:

- **When "Job Visibility Across Teams" is enabled** in the [Organization Security Settings](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/org-settings/#security-settings):
  Users and service accounts across all teams in your organization can view jobs and builds from any team.
- **When "Job Visibility Across Teams" is disabled:**
  Users and service accounts can only view jobs and builds associated with their active team.

### Using Sauce Connect Proxy with a Service Account

If you plan to run tests through a [Sauce Connect Proxy tunnel](/secure-connections/), be mindful of tunnel sharing options. Service accounts cannot create or manage tunnels, so you must use a tunnel that has been shared with the service accountâ€™s assigned team. For detailed configuration instructions, refer to the [shared tunnels section](/secure-connections/sauce-connect-5/guides/overview/#shared-tunnels).
