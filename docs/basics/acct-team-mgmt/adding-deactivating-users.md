## Adding Users

If you are an organization administrator, you can add users to your organization or team by inviting them via email, or by adding them manually to the organization or team.

When you add a user manually, you assign the user a user name and password. To allow a user to set their own user name and password, invite them via email.

### Adding a User Manually

1. On Sauce Labs, click **ACCOUNT** and then click **Organization Management**.

3. On the **MANUAL ENTRY** tab, enter an email address, user name, password, and optional first and last name for the new user.

4. In the **ADD TO TEAM** dropdown, select the team for the user. If you don't select a team, the user will be added to the default team.
5. In the **ORG ROLE** dropdown, select an organizational role for the user. The options are Org. Admin, Team Member, and Member. For more information about the permissions associated with each role, see [User Roles](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/managing-user-info/#user-roles).
6. Click **ADD USER**.

### Adding a User Via Email

1. On Sauce Labs, click **ACCOUNT** and then click **Organization Management**.
2. On the **USERS** tab, click the blue plus sign.
3. On the **INVITE VIA EMAIL** tab, enter the user's email address, and then select a role from the **USER ROLE** dropdown.

4. To invite multiple users to the same team, click **Add Another Row** and add the additional users' information.
5. In the **ADD TO TEAM** dropdown, select the team to which to add the user(s).
6. Click **SEND INVITE**.

:::note
If you invite a user by email, you will need to wait until they accept your invitation before you can edit the concurrency settings for their account and associate them with other accounts.

### SSO Considerations

If SSO and the **Require Single Sign-On** option is enabled for your
organization (see [Single Sign-On Settings](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/org-settings/#sso-advanced-options)),
new users will be outside your IdP. This means they will not be able to log in
to Sauce Labs using the credentials you provided when you created their account
(they will be able to run test automation, however). In this situation, you
should add users manually.

If SSO is enabled but the **Require Single Sign-On** option is not, you can add new users manually, but not via email.

For example, in the following scenarios you may need to add non-SSO users to your Sauce Labs account:

- You have a user account for Jenkins or another CI/CD server that needs to access Sauce Labs, but won't log in via the UI. This option is consistent with the **Require Single Sign-On** option, as that machine or user will never log into the SauceLabs portal.
- You have a group of contractors who will be using your Sauce Labs account, but won't be added to your organization's IdP. This option is NOT consistent with the **Require Single Sign-On** option, as in this case the contractors are likely to need access to the Sauce Labs portal.

## Deactivating Users

You can deactivate users in your account on the **Organization Management** page and also on the **User Details** page.

### Deactivating a User - Organization Management

1. On Sauce Labs, click **ACCOUNT** and then click **Organization Management**.
2. On the **USERS** tab, select the check box of the user you want to deactivate.
3. Above the list of users, in the **Action** dropdown, click **Deactivate User**.

4. In the **Confirm deactivate** box, click **Yes, Deactivate**.

### Deactivating a User - User Details

2. On the **USERS** tab, click the user name of the user you want to deactivate.
