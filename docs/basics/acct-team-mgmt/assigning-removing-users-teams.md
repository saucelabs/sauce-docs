4. In the **Team Assignment** box, in the **Select team** dropdown, select the team to assign the user to.

A user can only be assigned to one team; changing a user's team assignment will remove the association with the previous team.

2. On the **Teams** tab, click the team whose user you want to remove.
3. On the **Members** tab, select the checkbox of the user you want to remove.
4. Next to **User Selected**, in the **Action** dropdown, click **Remove User from team**.
