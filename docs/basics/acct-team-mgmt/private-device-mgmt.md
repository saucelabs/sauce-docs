Private device management allows an organization admin to view and manage the private devices in an organization via the [Private Device Management](https://app.saucelabs.com/team-management/devices) panel. These features can improve device availability and optimize manual and automation workflows.

- Assign a private device to a team.
- Customize a private device to allow apps, system apps, and accounts to persist between sessions.

:::important

- Everyone in an organization can access a device in the the default unassigned state.
- **Only** organization admins can manage private devices.
  - An organization admin can always re-assign a device to another team or set a device to the default unassigned state.
- **Only** team members can access a device assigned to a team.
  - This rule is enforced for all roles!
    - i.e., to access a device, an organization admin **must** be a member of the team a device is assigned to.
  - Devices automcatically return to the default unassigned state if their assigned team is deleted.

## App Allow List

The [device cleaning process](/mobile-apps/real-device-cleaning) will remove apps installed from [Sauce Storage](/mobile-apps/app-storage) and the App Store/Play Store between sessions. To have installed apps and app data persist between sessions, update this setting for each of the application identifiers. This might be the app you are testing or dependent apps, e.g. MFA app, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.

:::important
This setting does **NOT** install the app. You must manually or via automation install the desired version of the matching app.

- For iOS devices, use the Bundle ID.
  - [How to find the bundle ID on a Sauce Labs device](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/private-device-mgmt-find-bundle-id)
- For Android devices, use the package name.

`com.google.chrome.ios`  
`com.apps.app1`  
`com.ios.app2`  

*Multiple entries must be comma-separated.*

## System App Allow List (iOS)

Certain iOS preinstalled apps are hidden by default, e.g. Messages, Mail, Notes. To access iOS preinstalled applications, add the bundle ID for each app.

## Retain folders/filepath (Android)

You have the option to retain specific filepaths or folders on your private Android devices between sessions. 
This feature ensures that selected data remains intact during the device cleaning process.

- Filepaths or folders associated with specific applications can be retained.
- This is especially useful for retaining data that is crucial for continuous testing or for maintaining certain app states.

By default, the following folders are not cleaned on your private Android devices, ensuring that their contents are retained between sessions (iOS/Android):
- Documents
- Pictures
- Downloads
- DCIM

:::note
You can only retain specific folders created inside tmp. You cannot retain the whole tmp folder.
Valid: `/data/local/tmp/retain`
Invalid path: `/data/local/tmp/`

:::important
`/data/com.wavelink.velocity/files`  
`/com.my.app/data/temp/folder`

*Multiple entries must be comma-separated.*

## Enable Apple Pay

Enable this setting to test Apple Pay. This will persist assistive touch on the device, which is required to confirm payment. 
Please send us a support ticket to set up Confirm with AssistiveTouch on your device. This requires manual intervention from our side.

:::important
This feature **requires** setting the Account Allow List.  
Please see [Testing Apple Pay](/mobile-apps/live-testing/testing-apple-pay) for more information.
