## Updating User Information

Organization admins can update the name, email address, user name, role, and team assignment for any user in their organization. Team admins can update that information for users on their team. If you invite a user via email, you will need to edit their concurrency limit and other account details after they have accepted your invitation and created an account.

1. On Sauce Labs, click **ACCOUNT** and then click **Organization Management**.

In every organization, multiple Organization Admins and/or Team Admins can exist. However, users can only be part of one organization.

For more information on Sauce Connect and IPSec settings available to Organization Admins, see [Security Settings](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/org-settings#security-settings).

## User Settings

The User Settings screen allows you to view and change your password and email
address. You can also regenerate an access key, as well as copy a driver string
(for more information, see [Regenerating Access Keys](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/managing-user-info/#regenerating-access-keys)
and [Create a Remote Session](/web-apps/automated-testing/selenium/#step-1-create-a-remote-session)).
If you are an admin and want to change the settings for users in your org, see
[Updating User Information](/basics/acct-team-mgmt/managing-user-info/#updating-user-information).

To access the User Settings screen, on Sauce Labs, click **ACCOUNT** and then click **User settings**.
