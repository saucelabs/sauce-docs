:::

1. In Sauce Labs, in the left panel, click **AUTOMATED** or **LIVE** and then click **Test Results**.
2. Click the test whose results you want to view.
3. On the **Test Details** page, you can do the following:
  * Click the play button to view screenshots and video of the test. Audio is not recorded.
  * Click the **COMMANDS** tab to see the API commands that were issued during the test. The **COMMANDS** tab also includes controls for filtering the commands displayed and playing back the commands.
  * Click the **LOGS** tab to see the logs generated by your test. The logs you can view are determined by the type of test you ran. For example, web application tests will include a Selenium log, while mobile application tests will contain an Appium log.
  * Click the **METADATA** tab to see the metadata attached to your test. Some of the test metadata, such as Passed, can be updated via the the [Sauce REST API](/dev/api). You can also download video and screenshots of your test in this tab.

### Appium Logs
The **Appium** Log tab in your test indicates that this test ran using the Appium driver. The first line of the log provides information about the Appium version used during your test (for example, `info: Welcome to Appium v1.4.0`).

To find logging specific to your OS:

* iOS - The iOS simulator log is embedded within the Appium log. The information from the iOS simulator is grayed out throughout the Appium log and has the tag name `info: [IOS_SYSLOG_ROW]`.
* Android - To find Android emulator logs, on the **METADATA** tab, search for the `Logcat.log` file. This file contains all the information from the Android emulator log.
