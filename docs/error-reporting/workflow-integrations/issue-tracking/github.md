## GitHub Integration
This guide goes through the steps necessary to integrate Backtrace with GitHub. Setting up integration with GitHub requires a valid GitHub endpoint URL, as well as an API token.

The steps in this process are:
- Generate an API token
- Set up the integration

## Generate an API Token
In GitHub, click the menu in the upper-right and select "Settings". In the Personal Settings menu on the left, click "Personal Access Tokens", then "Generate new token" on the upper-right to generate an API token.

Customize the security settings as desired, making sure that the token is granted access to create new Issues. Make a note of the token, you will need it for configuration below.

## Set Up the Integration
To set up the integration, first go to the **Project Settings** page for the project you want to add a integration for:

Then click **Integrations** in the left-hand menu, and the plus sign to create a new integration:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/add-wf-integration.png')} alt="" />

Select **GitHub** and fill in the required settings.

For more information about these settings, please refer to the [GitHub API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.3/v3/issues/#create-an-issue).

Next: After filling in the integration-specific settings, proceed to [Common Settings](/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/common-settings) to finish configuring the integration.
