## Slack Integration
This guide will go through the steps necessary to integrate Backtrace with Slack.

There are two main steps for setting up Slack:
- Set up the incoming webhook
- Create the integration

## Set up the Incoming Webhook
In order to set up integration for Slack, an Incoming WebHook must be configured in Slack - [Link to Webhook config](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/). From there, follow the prompts to add the integration, then copy the Webhook URL that's generated - you will use this URL below.

## Create the Integration
To set up the integration, first go to the **Project Settings** page for the project you want to add a integration for:

Then click **Integrations** in the left-hand menu, and the plus sign to create a new integration:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/add-wf-integration.png')} alt="" />

Select **Slack** and fill in the required settings (name, webhook URL you generated above, and one or more channels/users to send the message to).

Next, customize the payload to include the content best suited for your team.

Then, configure options for when the notifications should fire.

Finally, add any rules to route notifications to certain channels or users based on crash attribute values.
