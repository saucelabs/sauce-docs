## Amazon SNS Integration
This guide will go through the steps necessary to integrate Backtrace with Amazon SNS.

There are two main steps for setting up Amazon SNS:
- Create a topic
- Set up the integration

## Create a Topic
If you haven't already done so, create an Amazon SNS topic that will receive Backtrace notifications. For information on how to do this, see [Amazon SNS - Create a Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html).

Also remember to [Create Subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html) to this topic.

## Set Up the Integration
To set up the integration, first go to the **Project Settings** page for the project you want to add a integration for:

Then click **Integrations** in the left-hand menu, and the plus sign to create a new integration:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/add-wf-integration.png')} alt="" />

Select **Amazon SNS** and fill in the required settings:
- Integration name
- Topic name
- Access key (make sure this user has permission to publish to the provided SNS topic)
- Secret access key

Next: After filling in the integration-specific settings, proceed to [Common Settings](/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/common-settings) to finish configuring the integration.
