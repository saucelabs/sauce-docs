## Amazon SNS Integration
This guide will go through the steps necessary to integrate Backtrace with Amazon SNS.

There are two main steps for setting up Amazon SNS:
- Create a topic
- Set up the integration

## Create a Topic
If you haven't already done so, create an Amazon SNS topic that will receive Backtrace notifications. For information on how to do this, see [Amazon SNS - Create a Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html).

Also remember to [Create Subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html) to this topic.

## Set Up the Integration
To set up the integration, first go to the Configuration page within the Web Console:

Next, select the project you want to add a integration for:

Then click Integrations in the left-hand menu, then Create a New Integration on the right, and pick the integration:

For Amazon SNS, the required settings are:
- Topic Name
- Access Key - Make sure this user has permission to publish to the provided SNS topic.
- Secret Access Key

Next: After filling in the integration-specific settings, proceed to [Common Settings](/error-reporting/workflow-integrations/common-settings) to finish configuring the integration.
