description: Add Backtrace to your Unity project.
---
Add Backtrace to your Unity project to automatically detect and report crashes and errors that occur in your apps and games.

After you've completed the steps on this page, the Backtrace client will be installed and setup with the default configuration settings.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

## Features
The Backtrace Unity SDK reports on the following types of errors:

* Log errors - Error messages in the console log. Logged by Debug.LogError (a variant of Debug.Log).
* Unhandled Exceptions - Exceptions that occur outside of an explicit try/catch statement.
* Handled exceptions - Exceptions that are explicitly caught and handled.
* Crashes - An end to the game play experience, where the game crashes or restarts.
* Hangs (mobile only) -  Errors that occur when a game or an app is non-responsive.
* Out of memory crashes (mobile only) - Terminations of your game or app due to low memory conditions.
* Message reports - Error messages explicitly sent by the Backtrace client.

## Install the Backtrace Unity SDK
The following methods are available to install the Backtrace Unity SDK.

<Tabs
  groupId="platforms"
  defaultValue="openupm"
  values={[
    {label: 'OpenUPM', value: 'openupm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
    {label: 'Git', value: 'git'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="openupm">

```
# Install openupm-cli
npm install -g openupm-cli

# Go to your Unity project directory
cd YOUR_UNITY_PROJECT_DIR

# Install the latest io.backtrace.unity package
openupm add io.backtrace.unity
```

For more information, see the installation steps on [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/io.backtrace.unity/).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual">  

1. Download the latest version of the Backtrace Unity SDK from [GitHub](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-unity/releases).

1. Unzip the package and save it locally.

1. In your Unity project, go to Window > Package Manager.

1. Complete the steps in [Installing a package from a local folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html) in the Unity Documentation.

## Initialize the Backtrace Client with GameObject
In this step, you create the Backtrace Configuration asset, create a new GameObject, add the Backtrace Client component to the GameObject, then add the Backtrace Configuration to the Backtrace Client component.

You can add the Backtrace Client component to any GameObject in your game scene.

:::tip
Typically, the Backtrace Client component is added to a global GameManager or GameController object, given a descriptive name, and assigned a tag to identify it for scripting purposes.
:::

  1. In your Unity project, go to Assets > Backtrace > Configuration.

  The Backtrace Configuration file is added to the root of your Assets folder.

  1. Go to GameObject > Create Empty.

  1. Enter a descriptive name for the new GameObject.

  1. In the Inspector, select Add Component.

  1. Search for “Backtrace”, then select Backtrace Client.

  1. From the Assets folder, drag the Backtrace Configuration file to the Backtrace configuration field.

Additional fields now display for the Backtrace client configuration and database configuration options.

To change Backtrace client and database options, we recommend to change these values in the Unity UI via Backtrace Configuration file. Alternatively, you can also make changes to the configuration in the C# code for your Unity project.

For more information about the available configuration options, see [Configuration](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unity/configuration).

## Configure the Server Address
The server address is required to submit exceptions from your Unity project to your Backtrace instance.

  1. In the Backtrace Console, go to Project Settings > Integration Guides > Unity.

  1. Copy the Server Address.

  1. Go back to the Backtrace Configuration in your Unity project.

  1. In the Server Address field, enter the server address in the following format: `https://submit.backtrace.io/{subdomain}/{submission-token}/json`.

  Provide the name of your subdomain and a submission token.



## Verify the Setup
At this point, you've installed and setup the Backtrace client to automatically capture crashes and exceptions in your Unity game or app.

To test the integration, use a try/catch block to throw an exception and start sending reports.

 ```csharp
  //Read from manager BacktraceClient instance
 var backtraceClient = GameObject.Find("manager name").GetComponent<BacktraceClient>();

 //Set custom client attribute
 backtraceClient["attribute"] = "attribute value";

  //Read from manager BacktraceClient instance
 var database = GameObject.Find("manager name").GetComponent<BacktraceDatabase>();


 try{
     //throw exception here
 }
 catch(Exception exception){
     var report = new BacktraceReport(exception);
     backtraceClient.Send(report);
 }
 ```
