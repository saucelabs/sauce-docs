title: Setting Up Backtrace for Unreal Engine
sidebar_label: Setup
description: Add Backtrace to your Unreal Engine project.
---

Add Backtrace to your Unreal Engine project to automatically detect and report native crashes that occur in your game.

Backtrace supports Unreal Engine's Crash Reporter, therefore installation of a Backtrace SDK is not required to capture crashes.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

## Features

The Backtrace Unreal plugin reports on the following types of errors:

- Crashes - An end to the game play experience, where the game crashes or restarts.
- Hangs (mobile only) - Errors that occur when a game or an app is non-responsive.
- Out of memory crashes (mobile only) - Terminations of your game or app due to low memory conditions.
- Asserts - Used to detect and diagnose unexpected or invalid runtime conditions during development.

#### For Crashes in the Editor

1. In the root directory for your Unreal Engine project, open the Config folder.
2. Copy the `DefaultEngine.ini` file and paste it into the Engine > Config folder.
   :::note
   If the Engine folder doesn't exist at the root directory for your Unreal Engine project, create a new folder and name it Engine. Then in the Engine folder, create another folder and name it Config.
   :::
3. Rename the file to `UserEngine.ini`.
4. Open the `UserEngine.ini` file and add the following lines:

   ```bash
   [CrashReportClient]
   CrashReportClientVersion=1.0
   DataRouterUrl="https://unreal.backtrace.io/post/{subdomain}/{submission-token}"
   ```

5. For the `DataRouterUrl`, provide the name of your [subdomain and a submission token](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unreal/setup/#what-youll-need).

When your app or game crashes in the Unreal Editor, the Unreal Engine Crash Reporter dialog will appear and allow you to send the crash report to your Backtrace instance.

### For Crashes in Packaged Builds

#### Enable the Crash Reporter

1. In the Unreal Editor, go to **Edit > Project Settings**.
1. In the Project Settings, search for "crash reporter".
1. Under **Packaging**, enable **Include Crash Reporter**.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/error-reporting/unreal-enable-crashreporter.png')} alt="Enable the Crash Reporter in the Unreal Editor." />

:::note
If you're building from the command line, add the `-crashreporter` flag.
:::

#### Configure the Crash Reporter

You can configure the crash reporter to be the default for all packaged builds or for a single packaged build.

To configure the crash reporter as the default for all packaged builds:

1. In the root directory for your Unreal Engine project, open the Config folder.
1. Copy the `DefaultEngine.ini` file and paste it into the following directory:
   `[UNREAL_ENGINE]/UnrealEngine/Engine/Programs/CrashReportClient/Config`
   :::note
   The directory could also be under `C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_[version]`. You can also search your system for 'CrashReportClient' to find it.
   :::
1. Open the `DefaultEngine.ini` file and add the following lines:
   ```
   [CrashReportClient]
   CrashReportClientVersion=1.0
   DataRouterUrl="https://unreal.backtrace.io/post/{subdomain}/{submission-token}"
   ```
1. For the `DataRouterUrl`, provide the name of your [subdomain and a submission token](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unreal/setup/#what-youll-need).

To configure the crash reporter for a packaged build:

1. In the root directory for your Unreal Engine project, open the Config folder.
1. Copy the `DefaultEngine.ini` file and paste it into the following directory:
   - For Unreal Engine 4.25 and earlier:
     `[BUILD_DIRECTORY]/WindowsNoEditor/Engine/Programs/CrashReportClient/Config/NoRedist`
   - For Unreal Engine 4.26 and higher:
     `[BUILD_DIRECTORY]/WindowsNoEditor/Engine/Restricted/NoRedist/Programs/CrashReportClient/Config`
     :::note
     Create the subdirectories if they do not exist.
     :::
1. Open the `DefaultEngine.ini` file and add the following lines:
   ```
   [CrashReportClient]
   CrashReportClientVersion=1.0
   DataRouterUrl="https://unreal.backtrace.io/post/{subdomain}/{submission-token}"
   ```
1. For the `DataRouterUrl`, provide the name of your [subdomain and a submission token](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unreal/setup/#what-youll-need).

Integrate the [backtrace-android](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-android) error reporting library with your Unreal Engine game for Android written in Java or Kotlin.

1. Download [BacktraceAndroid_UPL.xml](https://gist.github.com/ianrice07/36d8731f0d1af10af4803288c7c86c10).
1. In the `BacktraceAndroid_UPL.xml` file, provide the name of your [subdomain and a submission token](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unreal/setup/#what-youll-need) for `BacktraceCredentials`.
   - Java:
     ```java
     BacktraceCredentials credentials = new BacktraceCredentials("https://submit.backtrace.io/{subdomain}/{submission-token}/json");
     ```
   - Kotlin:
     ```java
     val backtraceCredentials = BacktraceCredentials("https://submit.backtrace.io/{subdomain}/{submission-token}/json")
     ```
1. In the directory for your Unreal Engine project, locate your app or game's `Build.cs` file.
1. Place the `BacktraceAndroid_UPL.xml` file in the same directory with the `Build.cs` file.
1. In the `Build.cs` file, add the following lines at the end of the `ModuleRules` class constructor:

   ```
   if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Android)
   {
     string PluginPath = Utils.MakePathRelativeTo(ModuleDirectory, Target.RelativeEnginePath);
     AdditionalPropertiesForReceipt.Add("AndroidPlugin", System.IO.Path.Combine(PluginPath, "BacktraceAndroid_UPL.xml"));
   }
   ```

1. Download the [BacktraceWrapper.h](https://gist.github.com/lysannep/6c09a572baffede96cd250dbdf01279a#file-backtracewrapper-h) header file and add it to your GameInstance.
1. To initialize the Backtrace client, use `BacktraceIO::FInitializeBacktraceClient`.
   :::note
   It's recommended to initialize the client from the `GameInstance::OnStart()` method. However, if the method is not available, you can initialize the client with any method you use to start your app or game process.
   :::
   :::note
   Optionally, you can specify custom attributes and file attachment paths to submit with your error reports. If you choose to specify file attachment paths, they must be specified as Android paths. For example, to specify a file attachment path for your `ProjectSavedDir()`, use:
   ```
   if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Android)
   #include "Misc/App.h"
   #if PLATFORM_ANDROID
   extern FString GFilePathBase;
   FString FileAttachmentPath = GFilePathBase + FString("/UE4Game/") + FApp::GetName() + TEXT("/") + FApp::GetName() + TEXT("/Saved") + TEXT("MyFileName.txt");
   #endif
   ```
   For more details on how to convert your Unreal Engine paths to Android paths, see the conversion functions for `FAndroidPlatformFile::PathToAndroidPaths` in the `AndroidPlatformFile.cpp` file.
   :::

To change the default configuration settings for the Backtrace client, you can change the settings in the `BacktraceAndroid_UPL.xml` file. For more information, see [Configuring Backtrace for Android](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/android/configuration/) for the backtrace-android library.

<TabItem value="ios">

Integrate the [backtrace-cocoa](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-cocoa) native error reporting library with your iOS Unreal Engine game.

1. From [Releases](https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-cocoa/releases), download the `Archive_UE.tar.gz` archive.
1. Unarchive and Copy the `Backtrace.xcframework` into the directory of your Unreal Engine project.
1. Locate your app or game's `Build.cs` file.
1. In the `Build.cs` file, add the following lines at the end of the `ModuleRules` class constructor:

   ```
   if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.IOS) {
    PublicAdditionalFrameworks.Add(new Framework("Backtrace", "../Path/To/Framework/Backtrace.xcframework/ios-arm64/Backtrace.framework", null, true));
    }
   ```

5. To initialize the Backtrace client, use the following to import `Backtrace-Swift.h` from `Backtrace.framework/Headers`:

   ```
   #if PLATFORM_IOS
   #import <Backtrace/Backtrace-Swift.h>
   #endif

   void UYourGameInstanceBase::OnStart()
   {
   #if PLATFORM_IOS

   BacktraceCredentials *credentials = [[BacktraceCredentials alloc]
           initWithSubmissionUrl: [NSURL URLWithString: @"https://submit.backtrace.io/{subdomain}/{submission-token}/plcrash"]];
   BacktraceClientConfiguration *configuration = [[BacktraceClientConfiguration alloc]
                                                     initWithCredentials: credentials
                                                     dbSettings: [[BacktraceDatabaseSettings alloc] init]
                                                     reportsPerMin: 3

                                                     detectOOM: TRUE];
   BacktraceClient.shared = [[BacktraceClient alloc] initWithConfiguration: configuration error: nil];
   #endif
   }
   ```

1. For the `initWithSubmissionUrl`, provide the name of your [subdomain and a submission token](/error-reporting/platform-integrations/unreal/setup/#what-youll-need).

Follow the instructions for setting up crash reporting in Windows. The Steam Deck will not show the CrashReportClient after a crash, so there will be no option for users to click the send button. To enable sending, `-Unattendded` can be added to the launch options for the game. This option sends crash reports without user intervention or knowledge, like the Windows client normally allows.

</Tabs>

## Upload Debug Symbols

You must now ensure your build environment has been configured to generate debug symbols, which can then be uploaded to your Backtrace instance, a connected Symbol Server, an Amazon S3 bucket, or a Google Cloud storage bucket.

For information on how to generate symbols, see [Symbolication](/error-reporting/project-setup/symbolication/).

## Verify the Setup

At this point, you've installed and setup the Backtrace client to automatically capture crashes in your Unreal Engine game or app.

To test the integration, send a crash report to your Backtrace instance.

To crash your game when it starts, create a class called MyActor and reference a blueprint. The blueprint can be attached to the BeginPlay event.

The header file (which has the .h extension) contains the class definitions and functions, while the implementation of the class is defined by the .cpp file. For example:

- `MyActor.h`:

  ```cpp
  // Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
  ​
  #pragma once
  ​
  #include "CoreMinimal.h"
  #include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
  #include "GenericPlatform/GenericPlatformCrashContext.h"
