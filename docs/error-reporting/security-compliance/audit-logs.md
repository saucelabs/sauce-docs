Backtrace provides audit log capabilities for customers. The audit log includes all login requests and configuration changes, including user management. Additional metadata is provided, including originating IP addresses and more.

## Enabling the Audit Log for On-Premise

To enable the audit log, add the following stanza to your `coronerd.conf` file (usually located in `/etc/coronerd`):

```json
"audit" : {
  "path" : "/var/log/coronerd/audit.db"
}
```

The default retention policy is 6 months, but it is possible to customize this. The `age_seconds` integer represents the number of seconds an audit log entry is stored before being removed. For example, the following stanza specifies that audit logs older than 1 hour (3600 seconds) are eligible for removal by the Backtrace system:

```json
"audit" : {
  "path" : "/var/log/coronerd/audit.db",
  "age_seconds": 3600
}
```

## Viewing the Audit Log

After the audit log is enabled, you can extract its contents using the `morgue` tool or by making a copy of the audit log directly. To extract the log and render it in a text format using `morgue`, use the `morgue audit extract` command.

The `--table` option can be used to render the data in a tabular format in your terminal, as shown below:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/error-reporting/5e601b6fe2ff7.png')} alt="tabluar format"/>

You can also render the audit log as a JSON object by using the `--json` option.

## Filtering the Audit Log

For advanced filtering of the audit log, you can use traditional utilities such as `grep` or `jq`. For example, the following command filters all audit log entries for the configuration subsystem.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/error-reporting/5e601b71f0164.png')} alt="filter all audit log entries"/>

## Multitenant Configuration and Access Control

Regular users and administrators have access to audit logs belonging to their tenant (universe) only. A superuser has access to audit logs for all tenants. To filter the audit log for a specific tenant, a superuser can specify the `--universe` option with the `morgue audit extract` command. For example, `morgue audit extract --universe=A` provides audit log entries for tenant A.
