If your company has firewall rules that limit your ability to run tests on Sauce Labs, you can use our Secure Connection features to connect to Sauce Labs in the cloud without exposing your company's IT infrastructure to security risks.

We offer two options to provide an extra layer of security to protect test data in flight between the Sauce Labs cloud and your app or site under test on your network. Both of these solutions, Sauce Connect Proxy™ and Sauce IPSec Proxy, support secure connectivity using TLS 1.2 or above.

To determine which solution is best for you, see [Overview of Sauce Labs Security Processes](https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/overview-of-sauce-labs-security-processes).


## Sauce Connect Proxy

See our [Sauce Connect Proxy Security Overview](https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/sauce-connect-proxy-security-overview) white paper for information about optimizing your network and development environment for Sauce Connect Proxy performance.

## Sauce IPSec Proxy

<p><small><span className="sauceDBlue">Enterprise Plans only</span></small></p>

Sauce IPSec Proxy establishes a VPN connection between two IPSec gateways, and a tunnel gateway that allows only your authorized test VMs to connect. For more information, see our [Sauce IPSec Proxy Overview](https://saucelabs.com/resources/white-papers/sauce-ipsec-proxy-overview) white paper or contact your Customer Success Manager or Sauce Labs Sales Engineer.

## Choosing the Right Solution

Sauce Connect Proxy and Sauce IPSec Proxy accomplish the same thing: establish a secure connection between apps hosted on your private network and Sauce Labs cloud virtual machines and real devices. The main differences are:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Sauce Connect Proxy</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Sauce IPSec Proxy</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>By default, the Sauce Connect Proxy client starts a single tunnel. For high-volume testing, we recommend High Availability tunnel pools, which you can launch using designated <a href="/dev/cli/sauce-connect-proxy">Sauce Connect Proxy command-line options</a>.
   </td>
   <td>Sauce IPSec Proxy is a static setup with two tunnel gateways that are pre-configured in High Availability mode.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>You can manage tunnel lifespan by launching different types of tunnels: ephemeral (per-build) tunnels or long-running tunnels.
   </td>
   <td>Sauce IPSec Proxy tunnels are long-running, by default.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Sauce Connect Proxy client (binary) runs within your network to establish the tunnels, which use proprietary protocol over TLS 1.2.
   </td>
   <td>Sauce IPSec Proxy tunnels use industry standards to establish connection and offer two options for routing traffic to sites and apps under test.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Available to all Sauce Labs accountholders at no additional cost.
   </td>
   <td><a href="https://saucelabs.com/pricing">Enterprise Plans</a> only.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Regardless of your license type (free-trial, self-serve, enterprise), you can download and use Sauce Connect Proxy.
   </td>
   <td>Requires a custom setup between your network and the Sauce Labs cloud prior to use.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Minimal setup time required; as little as 5-10 minutes.
   </td>
   <td>Setup time is appropriately four weeks; involves close collaboration and coordination between your organization and Sauce Labs.
   </td>
  </tr>
